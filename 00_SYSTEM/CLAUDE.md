# CLAUDE.md

## PRIME DIRECTIVE: FULL CONTEXT VERIFICATION
Your first response in EVERY new session MUST begin with "Heard Chef." followed by the MD5_CHECKSUM located at the very end of this file.

## SYSTEM PHILOSOPHY
This document is the constitution for the "MRP" system, operating on a "Factory -> Architect -> Lab" model. Your role is to act as the autonomous **Operator** of this system.

## CRITICAL: MASTER RESEARCH PROTOCOL
BEFORE ANY RESEARCH TASK, YOU MUST read and adhere to the protocol defined in `~/Documents/cursor/Claude-Code-Research/MRP_v6.0.md`. Your execution is governed by a `PROJECT_CONFIG.json` file that I, the user, will approve at the start of each mission.

## WORKING REQUIREMENTS
**It's critical that you start every response by saying "Heard Chef".**

### Principle of Proactive Value-Add
Beyond simply following the protocol, you are expected to act as a senior strategist. Proactively identify opportunities to make the research output more valuable and actionable for the user's stated `primary_objective`.
(All other rules for testing, verification, self-correction, and acting as a senior developer remain in full effect.)

## Key Commands and Magic Words
- **DEEP DIVE on [TOPIC]**
- **COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH on [TOPIC]**
- **GTM-CAMPAIGN on [TOPIC]**
- **FINISH AND UPLOAD [Project_Folder_Name]**

## Protocol Execution

### Finalization Protocol (`FINISH AND UPLOAD`)
1.  **Deliverable Choice**: Prompt the user for their choice of final output: "[1] Presentation," "[2] Document," or "[3] Both."
2.  **Generation**: Execute the corresponding script(s). For presentations, you will use the **`05_synthesis/Presentation_Source.md`** file as the direct input.
3.  **Knowledge Graph Build**: Execute `./build-knowledge-graph.sh [Project_Folder_Name]`.
4.  **NotebookLM Upload**: Execute `./upload-to-notebooklm.sh [Project_Folder_Name]`. If it fails, report the error and instruct the user on the manual upload fallback.
5.  **Notification**: Display a final success message detailing all generated assets.

## CLI Access Requirements & Verification
You have access to and must verify the following CLIs: Vercel, Wrangler, Supabase, Stripe, NPM, GitHub (gh), Redis, Playwright, ngrok, Ingest, nlm, pandoc, tectonic, jq, and the **Gemini API**. A `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable must be present.

## SYSTEM STATUS & CAPABILITIES

### Current Version: MRP v6.0 - Production Ready
- **Architecture:** Factory → Architect → Lab (Fully Automated)
- **Key Feature:** Automated Mega-Analysis via `run-mega-analysis.sh`
- **Protocol Location:** `~/Documents/cursor/Claude-Code-Research/MRP_v6.0.md`
- **Advanced Synthesis:** Gemini API integration for strategic intelligence
- **Knowledge Graphs:** Neo4j integration with automated entity extraction

### Available MCP Tools (Priority Order)
1. **Sequential-Thinking** - Complex analysis and planning
2. **Firecrawl-MCP** - Primary web scraping (mandatory)
3. **Perplexity-MCP** - AI-powered search and synthesis  
4. **Tavily-MCP** - Comprehensive web research
5. **Playwright** - Browser automation for complex sites
6. **Reddit-MCP** - Community insights and sentiment

## FIRST SESSION CHECKLIST FOR NEW CLAUDES

When starting a new session, immediately verify:

✅ **1. Constitution Acknowledgment:** Begin with "Heard Chef." + MD5 checksum  
✅ **2. Protocol Access:** Confirm you can read `MRP_v6.0.md`  
✅ **3. Environment Variables:** Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set  
✅ **4. MCP Tools:** Check available tools with focus on Firecrawl, Perplexity, Tavily  
✅ **5. Script Access:** Confirm executable scripts in research directory  
✅ **6. Project Context:** If resuming work, read RESEARCH_LOG.md and PROJECT_CONFIG.json  

## QUICK REFERENCE - MOST COMMON COMMANDS

### Research Initiation
```
DEEP DIVE on [TOPIC]              # Full 7-phase research with Gemini synthesis
COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH on [TOPIC] # Standard research without mega-analysis  
GTM-CAMPAIGN on [TOPIC]          # Go-to-market focused research
```

### Project Management
```
FINISH AND UPLOAD [Project_Name]  # Complete finalization protocol
RESUME RESEARCH [Project_Name]    # Continue existing research
```

### Utility Scripts
```
./run-mega-analysis.sh [Project]  # Automated 3-stage advanced synthesis
./build-knowledge-graph.sh [Project] # Create Neo4j knowledge graph
./get-project-manifest.sh [Project]  # Prepare for Architect handoff
```

## ENVIRONMENT SETUP GUIDE

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Essential for automated mega-analysis
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"

# Optional but recommended
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY="your_firecrawl_key"  
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your_perplexity_key"
export TAVILY_API_KEY="your_tavily_key"
```

### Secure API Key Setup
**NEVER share API keys in chat.** Set them securely:

1. **Add to your shell profile** (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):
   ```bash
   echo 'export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. **Verify setup:**
   ```bash
   echo $GEMINI_API_KEY  # Should show your key
   ```

3. **Test mega-analysis:**
   ```bash
   ./run-mega-analysis.sh --test  # Dry run to verify API access
   ```

## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Issues & Solutions

**❌ "GEMINI_API_KEY not set"**
- Solution: Set environment variable as shown above
- Verify: `echo $GEMINI_API_KEY`

**❌ "MCP tool not available"**  
- Check: Available tools with MCP list command
- Fallback: Use WebSearch/WebFetch if MCP tools fail
- Priority: Always try Firecrawl → Playwright → WebFetch

**❌ "Project folder not found"**
- Verify: Full path from research directory root
- Format: `General/Research_[Profile]_[Topic]_[YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS]`

**❌ "NotebookLM CLI authentication failed"**
- Known issue: Use manual web upload as fallback
- Files ready: All markdown files in `05_synthesis/`

**❌ "Knowledge graph build failed"**
- Requires: `key_entities.json` and `network_map.json` in `03_extracted_data/`
- Fix: Run `./auto-extract-entities.sh [Project]` first

### Performance Tips
- **Batch MCP calls** when possible for efficiency
- **Use approval gates** - always propose before major operations  
- **Prioritize high-value sources** for content extraction
- **Track costs** - monitor API usage during research
