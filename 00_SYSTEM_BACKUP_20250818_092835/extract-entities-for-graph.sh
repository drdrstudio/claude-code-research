## For the AI Assistant:

Please analyze all research documents in this project and extract:

### 1. KEY ENTITIES (‚Üí key_entities.json)

**People:**
- Format: {"name": "Full Name", "role": "Title/Description"}
- Include: Executives, founders, board members, key personnel, investigators, regulators

**Companies:**
- Format: {"name": "Company Name", "industry": "Industry Type"}
- Include: Target companies, portfolio companies, competitors, partners, subsidiaries

**Organizations:**
- Format: {"name": "Org Name", "type": "Organization Type"}
- Include: Government agencies, NGOs, industry associations, universities

**Legal Entities:**
- Format: {"name": "Entity Name", "type": "Court/Agency/Firm"}
- Include: Courts, regulatory bodies, law firms

### 2. RELATIONSHIPS (‚Üí network_map.json)

**Format:** {"source": "Entity A", "target": "Entity B", "type": "relationship_type"}

**Common relationship types:**
- Employment: works_for, former_employee, founder, ceo, board_member
- Ownership: owns, invested_in, acquired, portfolio_company
- Family: son_of, daughter_of, spouse_of, sibling_of
- Legal: sued_by, investigating, regulated_by, represented_by

- Educational: alumnus_of, professor_at, graduated_from

### 3. TIMELINE (‚Üí timeline.json)

**Format:** {"date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "event": "Description", "entities": ["Entity1", "Entity2"]}

## IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Extract from ALL documents in the project (searches, fetched content, analysis)
- Use exact names consistently (e.g., always "Bob Crants III" not "Bob Crants")
- Include historical relationships with past tense markers (former_, ex_)
- Capture both positive and negative relationships
- Include dates where available in timeline
