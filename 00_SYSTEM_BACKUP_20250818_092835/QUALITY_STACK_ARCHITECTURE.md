# Quality Stack Intelligence Architecture
## The Comprehensive, Completeness-First Approach

### Core Philosophy
**COMPLETENESS > SPEED > COST** - Leave no stone unturned. Premium clients pay for exhaustive intelligence, not quick summaries.

### The Quality Stack (What Actually Works)

#### 1. Factual Intelligence Layer
- **Perplexity MCP**: AI-powered comprehensive search synthesis
- **Firecrawl MCP**: Deep content extraction from all sources
- **DataForSEO**: Enterprise SERP data and competitive analysis
- **SEC EDGAR**: Real regulatory filings (when applicable)

#### 2. Social Sentiment Layer (CRITICAL - The Missing Piece)
- **Reddit MCP**: Community truth and authentic discussions
- **X/Twitter (via Apify)**: Public discourse and real-time sentiment
- **YouTube API**: Video content and comment sentiment
- **Glassdoor**: Employee perspectives and cultural insights

#### 3. Advanced Analysis Layer
- **Sequential Thinking MCP**: Complex analysis and strategic planning
- **GitHub API**: Technical footprint assessment
- **Trustpilot/BBB**: Customer reviews and business ratings

### Execution Principles

#### The Completeness Mandate
- EVERY available source must be exhausted
- Patient execution - wait for quality data
- Retry failed sources with different approaches
- No intelligence gap left unexplored

#### Parallel But Patient
- Run tools simultaneously for efficiency
- BUT wait for all results before proceeding
- Allow time for deep extraction
- Multiple passes if needed for completeness

#### Quality Through Exhaustive Coverage
- Every claim needs 3+ independent sources
- All social platforms must be thoroughly mined
- Historical data going back years, not months
- Deep second and third-level investigations

### What We Removed (The Fantasy Stack)

#### ❌ Complex Tiered System
- Over-engineered source routing
- Quota preservation logic
- Trial account rotation (mostly impossible)
- Complex fallback chains

#### ❌ Government Database Mining
- Most require authentication/payment
- SEC EDGAR is the main exception
- Court records are hit-or-miss
- Patent searches need specialized access

#### ❌ Free API Preservation
- Waiting for quotas = lost opportunity
- Free limits too restrictive for real research
- Time cost > API cost for quality research

### Missing Intelligence Sources (Now Added)

#### Critical Additions
1. **Glassdoor**: Employee sentiment (was underemphasized)
2. **YouTube**: Visual intelligence and comment mining
3. **GitHub**: Technical contributions and community standing
4. **Trustpilot**: Customer reviews aggregation
5. **Insider Trading Data**: SEC Form 4 filings
6. **Podcast Appearances**: Unguarded statements
7. **Conference Presentations**: Strategic reveals
8. **Non-English Sources**: International reputation

### Implementation Changes

#### Recipe Prompts Updated
All three prompts now include:
- Simplified quality stack architecture
- Aggressive fallback philosophy
- Social sentiment as mandatory layer
- Parallel execution requirements
- 500ms timeout thresholds
- Missing intelligence gap monitoring

#### Removed Complexity
- No more tiered source routing
- No complex quota management
- No trial account rotation attempts
- No sequential API chains
- No waiting for free sources

### The Reality Check Results

#### What Actually Provides Value:
✅ Comprehensive multi-source validation (minimum 3 sources per claim)
✅ Deep historical analysis (5+ years of data)
✅ Exhaustive social sentiment across ALL platforms
✅ Patient, thorough extraction of every document
✅ Second and third-level relationship mapping
✅ Multiple extraction passes for completeness

#### What Was Fantasy:
❌ Automated trial account creation
❌ Most government database access without credentials
❌ Complex quota preservation systems
❌ Believing speed matters more than completeness

### Quick Reference: Tool Priority

#### For Reputational Intelligence:
1. Perplexity (comprehensive synthesis)
2. Reddit (community truth)
3. X/Twitter via Apify (public discourse)
4. Firecrawl (deep extraction)
5. Glassdoor (if applicable)

#### For Organizational Intelligence:
1. DataForSEO (competitive analysis)
2. Glassdoor (employee sentiment)
3. Reddit (authentic discussions)
4. SEC EDGAR (financials)
5. Firecrawl (documents)

#### For GTM Intelligence:
1. DataForSEO (search data)
2. Reddit (customer pain points)
3. Ad Libraries (competitor strategies)
4. Perplexity (market synthesis)
5. Google Trends (demand signals)
