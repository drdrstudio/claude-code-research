## OVERVIEW

The 6-Phase Strategic Intelligence Framework represents the systematic default methodology for conducting enterprise-grade research on individuals, organizations, or strategic situations. This framework transforms basic biographical or descriptive research into comprehensive strategic intelligence through systematic application of specialized analysis phases.

### Framework Philosophy

**Core Principle:** Intelligence gathering must be **systematic, comprehensive, and actionable** rather than merely descriptive. Each phase builds upon previous phases to create a complete strategic understanding that enables confident decision-making.

**Quality Standard:** Enterprise-grade intelligence suitable for:
- Investment due diligence
- Partnership evaluations  
- Risk assessments
- Competitive analysis
- Strategic planning

---

## FRAMEWORK STRUCTURE

### Phase Sequence and Logic

The 6 phases follow a deliberate sequence from surface-level information gathering to strategic analysis:

1. **Surface Intelligence** → Basic facts and public information
2. **Financial Intelligence** → Economic performance and exposures
3. **Legal Intelligence** → Compliance, litigation, and regulatory issues
4. **Network Intelligence** → Professional relationships and influence mapping
5. **Risk Assessment** → Comprehensive vulnerability analysis
6. **Competitive Intelligence** → Strategic threats and market positioning

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phases 1-4** are **information gathering** phases
- **Phases 5-6** are **analytical synthesis** phases
- Each phase informs subsequent phases
- Risk Assessment (Phase 5) requires completion of Phases 1-4
- Competitive Intelligence (Phase 6) requires understanding from all previous phases
