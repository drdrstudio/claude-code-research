## KEY FINDINGS

### üîç MARKET OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFIED
- **No dedicated AI-enhanced Markdown to HTML converters** with seamless WordPress integration exist currently
- **Strong community demand** for better workflow solutions
- **Clear technical feasibility** with multiple implementation approaches

### üõ†Ô∏è RECOMMENDED TECHNICAL STACK
**Primary Approach:** WordPress Custom Page Template (Recommended)
- **AI Layer:** Jina Reader-LM (1.5B model) for intelligent conversion
- **Traditional Layer:** marked.js (client-side) + Parsedown (server-side)
- **Security:** Multi-layer validation and sanitization
- **Performance:** Hybrid client/server processing with caching

### üîê CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
1. Server-side MIME type validation
2. File extension whitelisting (.md, .txt only)
3. WordPress capability checks (administrator access only)
4. Content sanitization and XSS prevention
5. .htaccess file protection rules

### üöÄ AI INTEGRATION OPTIONS
**Tier 1 (Advanced):** Jina Reader-LM integration
- Performance: 0.72 ROUGE-L score (vs 0.43 for GPT-4o)
- Features: 256K context, multilingual support
- URL: https://jina.ai/news/reader-lm-small-language-models-for-cleaning-and-converting-html-to-markdown/

**Tier 2 (Hybrid):** Traditional + AI assistance
**Tier 3 (Basic):** marked.js + Parsedown only

### üìä COMMUNITY INSIGHTS
- **WordPress developers prefer custom solutions** over existing plugins
- **Security-first approach** strongly valued by community
- **AI-assisted development accepted** when properly tested
- **Real success stories** with tools like Cursor for WordPress plugin development
