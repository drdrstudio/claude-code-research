# Cold Email Mastery Patterns
*Advanced Cold Email Techniques for Claude*

## ðŸŽ¯ Pattern 1: The "Bad Guess" Hook

### Subject Line Testing Options:
- "It's a bad guess."
- "good guess?"
- "20 hours is a lot"

### Email Structure:

**Opening Hook**: Start with what "most people guess" (anchor low number)
```
$50K, [First name]

That's what most people 'guess' when asked how much manual data entry costs their company.
```

**Reality Bomb**: Hit them with the real (much higher) number + why
```
The real number is usually $200K-$400K when you factor in error rates, rework time, and the opportunity cost of having smart people doing grunt work. 
Ouch.
```

**Social Proof**: Brief client example with specific results
```
We helped Lectric eBikes eliminate manual data reconciliation and they gained 20-30 hours per month.
```

**Clear CTA**: Specific offer with benefit framing
```
Can I give you a (free) data-mapping audit to see how much [company name] might be leaking in money and time each month?
```

**Simple Sign-off**: Just name, no fluff
```
[Sender Name]
```
