3. **For RevOps**: "How much time does your sales team spend on manual data entry each week?"

### Follow-up Strategy:
After delivering value, natural progression to:
1. "Based on what we found, would you like me to show you how we solved similar issues for [similar company]?"
2. "I have a case study of how we helped [relevant client] achieve [specific outcome] - worth a look?"
3. "If you're interested in exploring this further, I can show you exactly how we'd approach fixing these issues."

- Generic whitepapers
- Webinar recordings
- "How-to" guides
- Email courses

### Venn's Strong Lead Magnets:

- **Valuable**: Would cost $10K+ from consultants
- **Relevant**: Directly addresses their current pain points
- **Trust-Building**: Demonstrates Venn's expertise before asking for anything
- **Natural Progression**: Leads directly to discovery of integration needs

3. **Progression Rate**: % who request follow-up meeting after receiving assessment
4. **Qualified Pipeline**: % who become qualified opportunities

### A/B Testing Opportunities:
