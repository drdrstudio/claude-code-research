Further, OpenAI products are now being integrated into high-risk industries like real estate and financial services where the consequences of incorrect or biased technology processing can be devastating for consumers.\n\n## Background\n\nOpenAI is a major U.S.-based AI research and development organization consisting of the 501(c)(3) non-profit, OpenAI Incorporated; multiple intermediary and holding companies, including OpenAI GP LLC; and its for-profit subsidiary corporation, OpenAI Global, LLC. OpenAI develops, operates, and markets generative AI products to millions of consumers and third-party AI deployers.\n\nWhile it claims to advance “safe and beneficial” AI, it has utterly failed to show evidence that its products meet even the few responsible development and use standards put forth, including Executive Order 14110 on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of AI and the White House’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. With no evidence of responsible development on display and increasingly serious examples of harms perpetuated by its products, EPIC has filed this complaint calling for an investigation.\n\n## EPIC’s Interest\n\nEPIC has played a [leading role](https://epic.org/issues/consumer-privacy/) in developing the authority of regulators to safeguard the rights of consumers, ensure the protection of personal data, and [address](https://epic.org/issues/ai/) AI harms. EPIC previously called attention to Thomson Reuters’ error-prone fraud detection system in two investigative reports, [*Outsourced & Automated*](https://epic.org/outsourced-automated/) and [*Screened & Scored in the District of Columbia*](https://epic.org/screened-scored-in-dc/). EPIC has continuously drawn attention to the harms perpetuated by generative AI systems in its [Generating Harms](https://epic.org/generating-harms/) reports.\n\n## News\n\n### [Four Leading Scholars and Advocates Join EPIC’s Advisory Board](https://epic.org/four-leading-scholars-and-advocates-join-epics-advisory-board/)\n\nJuly 30, 2025\n\n### [EPIC Tells Washington Supreme Court That Amazon’s Surveillance Capabilities Create Duty to Protect Users From Harmful Products](https://epic.org/epic-tells-washington-supreme-court-that-amazons-surveillance-capabilities-create-duty-to-protect-users-from-harmful-products/)\n\nJuly 28, 2025\n\n### [EPIC Calls Out CPPA as Board Votes to Adopt Weak Risk Assessment, ADMT, and Cybersecurity Regulations](https://epic.org/cppa-votes-to-adopt-weak-cybersecurity-risk-assessments-and-admt-regulations/)\n\nJuly 24, 2025\n\n[See All News](https://epic.org/?s=&_content-type=updates&_issues=ai)\n\n### [Four Leading Scholars and Advocates Join EPIC’s Advisory Board](https://epic.org/four-leading-scholars-and-advocates-join-epics-advisory-board/)\n\nJuly 30, 2025\n\n[See All News](https://epic.org/?s=&_content-type=updates&_issues=ai)\n\n## Support Our Work\n\nEPIC's work is funded by the support of individuals like you, who allow us to continue to protect privacy, open government, and democratic values in the information age.\n\n[Donate](/donate/)"

        "raw_content": " [Skip to main content](#main-content) \n\n# The FTC’s Investigation of OpenAI — *AI: The Washington Report*\n\nWelcome to this week’s issue of AI: *The Washington Report*, a joint undertaking of Mintz and its government affairs affiliate, ML Strategies. The accelerating advances in artificial intelligence (“AI”) and the practical, legal, and policy issues AI creates have exponentially increased the federal government’s interest in AI and its implications. In these weekly reports, we hope to keep our clients and friends abreast of that Washington-focused set of potential legislative, executive, and regulatory activities.\n\nIn this issue, we discuss the July 2023 [Civil Investigative Demand](https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/67a7081c-c770-4f05-a39e-9d02117e50e8.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_4) (“CID”) the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC” or “Commission”) served to ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Our key takeaways are:\n\n1. The OpenAI CID concerns the question of whether OpenAI “engaged in unfair or deceptive privacy or data security practices” or “engaged in unfair or deceptive practices relating to risks of harm to consumers, including reputational harm…”\n2. Utilizing the information gathered from the CID, the Commission may allege that OpenAI’s conduct has violated [Section 5 of the FTC Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/45), possibly resulting in fines or a consent decree.\n3. For the FTC, this investigation is a significant and concrete step towards the realization of the [Commission’s stated aim](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/EEOC-CRT-FTC-CFPB-AI-Joint-Statement%28final%29.pdf) of applying its consumer protection powers to the domain of AI.\n\n---\n\n## FTC Civil Investigative Demand Served to OpenAI Signals Intent to Apply Current Law to AI\n\nOn July 13, 2023, The Washington Post released a partially redacted [Civil Investigative Demand](https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/67a7081c-c770-4f05-a39e-9d02117e50e8.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_4) (“CID” or “OpenAI CID”) served by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) to [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), the developer of ChatGPT. The OpenAI CID contains 49 inquiries related to the company’s business practices and requests 17 classes of documents. The stated subject of the FTC’s investigation is to ascertain whether OpenAI “engaged in unfair or deceptive privacy or data security practices” or “engaged in unfair or deceptive practices relating to risks of harm to consumers, including reputational harm…”\n\nAs we [have discussed](https://www.mintz.com/insights-center/viewpoints/2191/2023-07-11-ftc-lurking-ai-washington-report) in previous newsletters, in the absence of clear regulatory guidelines from Congress, regulatory agencies have sought to utilize their existing authority to regulate the growing tide of AI products and services. Of these regulatory agencies, it is the [FTC that has been the most active](https://www.mintz.com/insights-center/viewpoints/2191/2023-07-11-ftc-lurking-ai-washington-report) in this field, [releasing non-binding business guidance](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/02/keep-your-ai-claims-check), co-signing the [joint statement](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/EEOC-CRT-FTC-CFPB-AI-Joint-Statement%28final%29.pdf) on bias in automated systems,[[1]](#_ftn1) and pioneering a new form of enforcement known as [algorithmic disgorgement](https://www.mintz.com/insights-center/viewpoints/2191/2023-07-11-ftc-lurking-ai-washington-report).\n\nAs discussed in our newsletter on [the FTC’s forays into AI enforcement](https://www.mintz.com/insights-center/viewpoints/2191/2023-07-11-ftc-lurking-ai-washington-report), the current Commission asserts that the FTC’s statutory authority under laws — including Section 5 of the FTC Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act — grant it the ability to regulate the conduct of AI developers whose practices violate these laws. In the case of the OpenAI CID, the FTC has requested information and documents from the company to ascertain if there is a case to be made that OpenAI’s conduct has violated Section 5 of the FTC Act.[[2]](#_ftn2)\n\n### **The Subject of the OpenAI CID**\n\nAs stated above, the OpenAI CID concerns whether the company has committed either of the following alleged violations of the FTC Act.\n\n1. **Mishandling of user data**: Whether OpenAI has engaged in unfair or deceptive data privacy or data security practices.\n2. **Causing reputational harm to consumers**: Whether OpenAI has engaged in unfair or deceptive practices that risked harm to consumers. The Commission’s focus here is the question of the extent to which OpenAI’s products cause “reputational harm” to consumers through the making of “false, misleading, disparaging, or harmful statements” about individuals.\n\nPast FTC investigations have dealt with both of these classes of potential Section 5 violations. The Commission has entered into a number of consent decrees with large technology companies regarding their data privacy and security practices, most notably with [Facebook in November 2011](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/2011/11/111129facebookagree.pdf). The FTC has also brought cases that have included claims of reputational harm to consumers, including a [2002 online privacy case](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/012-3214-eli-lilly-company-matter) involving pharmaceutical company Eli Lily [allegedly disclosing](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1255113/privacy_speech_mkohlhausen.pdf) “an email list of more than six hundred consumers using Prozac” without those customers’ consent.\n\nWhat is notable about the OpenAI CID, then, is not the potential violations of the FTC Act that the Commission is investigating, but rather the CID’s role in the FTC’s ongoing effort to assert its role as a leading regulator of AI. While FTC [business guidance](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2021/04/aiming-truth-fairness-equity-your-companys-use-ai) and [statements by leadership](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/03/opinion/ai-lina-khan-ftc-technology.html) have signaled the Commission’s intention to regulate this space, the serving of the OpenAI CID represents a significant and concrete step towards the realization of that goal. Regardless of whether the FTC is able to build a case that OpenAI committed Section 5 violations, and whether any such hypothetical case has merit, the outcome of this investigation could have significant implications for determining the scope of the FTC’s existing authority to regulate AI developers.\n\n### **Content of the OpenAI CID**\n\nTo ascertain whether OpenAI “engaged in unfair or deceptive privacy or data security practices,” the FTC requested that the company provide the following information regarding its business practices.\n\n* The data used to train OpenAI’s large language models (“OpenAI models”), the sources of said data, the categories of content included in such data, and all policies and procedures related to the vetting and selecting of said data.\n* Internal policies regarding the oversight of human reviewers of the OpenAI models.\n* Procedures followed to assess the safety of products made with OpenAI models prior to its launch. Processes surrounding the retraining and refining of OpenAI models.\n* Processes for preventing personal information from being included in the training data of OpenAI models.\n* Steps taken to mitigate the exposure of users’ personal information via API integrations and plug-ins.\n* OpenAI’s handling of a [March 2023 security incident](https://www.engadget.com/openai-says-a-bug-leaked-sensitive-chatgpt-user-data-165439848.html) in which users’ sensitive personal data were temporarily leaked.\n\nTo test whether OpenAI “engaged in unfair or deceptive practices relating to risks of harm to consumers, including reputational harm,” the FTC requested the following information:\n\n* Policies and procedures related to OpenAI’s large language model’s generation of statements about individuals, including processes for handling reports that models “have made…false, misleading, disparaging, or harmful statements” about individuals.\n* Steps taken to test and respond to the capacity of products made with OpenAI models to generate “statements about real individuals that are false, misleading, or disparaging.”\n* Processes for determining whether an individual is a “public figure” and whether that determination impacts the large language model’s treatment of that individual.\n\n### **Conclusion: A Model for Future FTC Enforcement Actions on AI?**\n\nBy serving a CID to leading AI developer OpenAI, the FTC has staked out a view that it can, under current law, police certain aspects of the evolution of AI. The [release of ChatGPT](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/05/19/a-short-history-of-chatgpt-how-we-got-to-where-we-are-today/?sh=4c53495a674f) in November 2022 set off the current wave of interest in AI regulation seen around the world. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been a conspicuous presence in the halls of Congress, as he has [called for AI regulation](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/technology/openai-altman-artificial-intelligence-regulation.html) in multiple Congressional hearings. FTC investigations are normally confidential, so details surrounding the course of this CID and the FTC’s evaluation of these issues vis-à-vis OpenAI will be difficult to obtain in real time. We will continue to monitor FTC initiatives in this area.\n\n---\n\n[[1]](#_ftnref1) The April 2023 “[Joint Statement on Enforcement Efforts Against Discrimination and Bias in Automated Systems](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/EEOC-CRT-FTC-CFPB-AI-Joint-Statement%28final%29.pdf),” signed by key officials from the FTC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Department of Justice, and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, asserts that the existing “legal authorities” of the undersigned agencies “apply to the use of automated systems.” For a more detailed analysis, please reference our [previous newsletter on the FTC](https://www.mintz.com/insights-center/viewpoints/2191/2023-07-11-ftc-lurking-ai-washington-report).\n\n[[2]](#_ftnref2) [Section 5 of the FTC Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/45) prohibits “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce…”\n\n[Subscribe To Viewpoints](/subscribe)\n\n### Published\n\n### Viewpoint Topics\n\n- [Antitrust](/insights-center/antitrust)\n- [Artificial Intelligence](/insights-center/artificial-intelligence)\n- [AI: The Washington Report](/insights-center/ai-washington-report)\n\n### Professionals\n\n- [Bruce D.

U.S. Federal Trade Commission has launched an investigation into ChatGPT creator OpenAI and whether the artificial intelligence company violated consumer protection laws by scraping public data and publishing false information through its chatbot.\n\nThe agency sent OpenAI a 20-page letter requesting detailed information on its AI technology, products, customers, privacy safeguards and data security arrangements.\n\nAn FTC spokesperson had no comment on the investigation, which was first reported by The Washington Post on Thursday.\n\nThe [FTC document the Post published](https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/67a7081c-c770-4f05-a39e-9d02117e50e8.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_4) told OpenAI that the agency was investigating whether it has “engaged in unfair or deceptive privacy or data security practices” or practices harming consumers.\n\nOpenAI founder Sam Altman tweeted disappointment that the investigation was disclosed in a “leak,” noting that would “not help build trust,” but added that the company will [work with the FTC](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1679602638562918405).\n\n“It’s super important to us that out technology is safe and pro-consumer, and we are confident we follow the law,” he wrote. “We protect user privacy and design our systems to learn about the world, not private individuals.”\n\nRelated Stories\n\n[![Image 10:

Italian regulators [temporarily blocked ChatGPT](https://apnews.com/article/chatgpt-openai-data-privacy-italy-b9ab3d12f2b2cfe493237fd2b9675e21) over privacy concerns, and privacy watchdogs in France, Spain, Ireland and Canada also are paying closer attention, including some that have launched investigations after receiving complaints.\n\nThe FTC’s move is a serious regulatory threat to the nascent but fast-growing AI industry, although it’s not the only challenge facing these companies.\n\nComedian Sarah Silverman and two other authors have [sued both OpenAI and Facebook parent Meta](https://apnews.com/article/sarah-silverman-suing-chatgpt-openai-ai-8927025139a8151e26053249d1aeec20) for copyright infringement, claiming that the companies’ AI systems were illegally “trained” by exposing them to datasets containing illegal copies of their works.\n\nOn Thursday, OpenAI and The Associated Press announced a deal under which the AI company will [license AP’s archive of news stories](https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-associated-press-ap-f86f84c5bcc2f3b98074b38521f5f75a).\n\nAltman has emerged as a global AI ambassador of sorts following his [testimony before Congress in May](https://apnews.com/article/chatgpt-openai-ceo-sam-altman-congress-73ff96c6571f38ad5fd68b3072722790) and a subsequent [worldwide tour](https://apnews.com/article/chatgpt-openai-altman-artificial-intelligence-0687c5645c191bceeb6c481deb985177), including [to Europe](https://apnews.com/article/chatgpt-openai-artificial-intelligence-rules-europe-1a249ab94593356940d8f56d15e8a019), where officials are putting the final touches on the world’s first comprehensive rules for AI.\n\nThe [regulations will focus on risky uses](https://apnews.com/article/ai-act-artificial-intelligence-europe-regulation-94e2b38703b38fdbfabc9580f845ef9a) such as predictive policing and social scoring and include provisions for generative AI to disclose any copyright material used to train its algorithms.\n\nAltman himself has [called for AI regulation](https://apnews.com/article/chatgpt-openai-ceo-sam-altman-congress-73ff96c6571f38ad5fd68b3072722790), although he has tended to emphasize difficult-to-evaluate existential threats such as the possibility that superintelligent AI systems could one day [turn against humanity](https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-risk-of-extinction-ai-54ea8aadc60d1503e5a65878219aad43).\n\nSome argue that focusing on a far-off “science fiction trope” of superpowerful AI could make it harder to take action against already existing harms that require regulators to dig deep on data transparency, discriminatory behavior and potential for trickery and disinformation.\n\n“It’s the fear of these systems and our lack of understanding of them that is making everyone have a collective freak-out,” Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a Brown University computer scientist and former assistant director for science and justice at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, told the AP in May. “This fear, which is very unfounded, is a distraction from all the concerns we’re dealing with right now.”\n\nNews of the FTC’s OpenAI investigation broke just hours after a [combative House Judiciary Committee hearing](https://apnews.com/article/republicans-ftc-khan-technology-companies-41610756160e10732f7ded6c587cec0e) in which FTC Chair Lina Khan faced off against Republican lawmakers, who said she has been too aggressive in pursuing technology companies over allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nRepublicans said she has been harassing Twitter since its acquisition by Elon Musk, arbitrarily suing large tech companies and declining to recuse herself from certain cases. Khan pushed back, arguing that more regulation is necessary as the companies have grown and that tech conglomeration could hurt the economy and

        "content": "On March 30, 2023, CAIDP filed a 46-page complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. The Center asked the Commission to begin an investigation of OpenAI and to prevent the release of further models until necessary guardrails are established. In a letter to the FTC Commissioners, Marc Rotenberg and Merve Hickok reminded the Commission that they previously declared that AI products should be “transparent, explainable, fair, and empirically sound while fostering accountability.” [...] WASHINGTON DC - The Center for AI and Digital Policy (CAIDP) has escalated its case against OpenAI, creator of the ChatGPT AI product, by filing asupplementto the original complaint lodged with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in March 2023, accusing OpenAI of \"unfair and deceptive practices.\"This CAIDP action introduces new developments in the global debate over ChatGPT and increases pressure on the FTC to expedite an investigation. [...] Today (Nov 15, 2023), the Center for AI and Digital Policy urged the Federal Trade Commission to move forward the investigation of OpenAI and issue an order to establish safeguards and guardrails for ChatGPT.\n\nIn March, CAIDP filed the initial Complaint against OpenAI. In July, CAIDP filed a Supplement, providing new evidence for the FTC to act. Shortly afterward, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that the FTC had opened the investigation CAIDP requested.",

The document signals a comprehensive inquiry aimed at gathering evidence on the key areas CAIDP argued require investigation of OpenAI's practices._\n\n* * *\n\n### UPDATE -CAIDP Submits New Filing to FTC, Urges Action in OpenAI Case (Nov. 15, 2023)\n\n* * *\n\nToday (Nov 15, 2023), the Center for AI and Digital Policy urged the Federal Trade Commission to move forward the investigation of OpenAI and issue an order to establish safeguards and guardrails for ChatGPT.\n\nIn March, CAIDP filed the initial Complaint against OpenAI. In July, CAIDP filed a Supplement, providing new evidence for the FTC to act. Shortly afterward, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that the FTC had opened the investigation CAIDP requested.\n\nIn the 37-page Supplement filed today, CAIDP highlights the enforcement actions taken by agencies outside the US, documents new problems with ChatGPT, calls attention to OpenAI’s failure to uphold commitments, quotes leading AI experts on the need to establish guardrails as soon as possible, and cites growing public concern about the use of personal data in AI products.\n\nIn a letter to Chair Lina Kahn, CAIDP also quoted President Biden's new Executive Order on AI:\n\n\"The Federal Government will enforce existing consumer protection laws and principles and enact appropriate safeguards against fraud, unintended bias, discrimination, infringements on privacy, and other harms from AI. Such protections are especially important in critical fields like healthcare, financial services, education, housing, law, and transportation, where mistakes by or misuse of AI could harm patients, cost consumers or small businesses, or jeopardize safety or rights.\"\n\nIn the original Complaint, CAIDP wrote:\n\n\"OpenAI, Inc., a California-based corporation, has released a product GPT-4 for the consumer market that is biased, deceptive, and a risk to privacy and public safety. The outputs cannot be proven or replicated. No independent assessment was undertaken prior to deployment. . . . There should be independent oversight and evaluation of commercial AI products offered in the United States. CAIDP urges the FTC to open an investigation into OpenAI, enjoin further commercial releases of GPT-4, and ensure the establishment of necessary guardrails to protect consumers, businesses, and the commercial marketplace.\"\n\n[CAIDP, Second Supplement (Nov. 14, 2023)](https://www.caidp.org/app/download/8485816363/CAIDP-Supplement-FTC-OpenAI-11142023.pdf?t=1725365713 \"CAIDP-Supplement-FTC-OpenAI-11142023.pdf\")\n\n[CAIDP, Letter to FTC Chair Lina Kahn (Nov. 14, 2023)](https://www.caidp.org/app/download/8485816463/CAIDP-Letter-FTC-OpenAI-11142023.pdf?t=1725365713 \"CAIDP-Letter-FTC-OpenAI-11142023.pdf\")\n\n* * *\n\n### UPDATE - CAIDP Updates ChatGPT Complaint, Urges Action by FTC (July 10, 2023)\n\n* * *\n\n**WASHINGTON DC** - The Center for AI and Digital Policy (CAIDP) has escalated its case against OpenAI, creator of the ChatGPT AI product, by filing a[supplement](https://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001mOLKkPw-SLvkUM7I0AmK4iktrNCHdBeNu4D_GRKUa8gZ_7L9MM8k5KKt5A06LFeGbVYeLCPoE8uphWOthD9QzJ3Nr1XPi5Hkw2BQYDJlCzJmUzhp_-W7uLVeN797TiqU1ijXG7uAsytH9anz4ZnlNsgvIs6oLdtqoToLIB8CKP5HNkMTdB-64UBoQVAGIM8xcbjp2SPQJg4FtIW8elPJwOIrvI5LS5s_dZ831JD2qwE=&c=didA6EIUA2rJvcDfO7jDAOws5q_OxA-QNlG-mR1PTgigjlfOTklurg==&ch=iY8u32d-PSajhZetdRnqCEp2S4HofaqPsz3d6xjmwpKA2iiHsxSINQ==)to the original complaint lodged with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in March 2023, accusing OpenAI of \"unfair and deceptive practices.\"This CAIDP action introduces new developments in the global debate over ChatGPT and increases pressure on the FTC to expedite an investigation.\n=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================\n\nChatGPT has been the center of numerous investigations from consumer agencies around the world since the original CAIDP complaint. Many of these international investigations have resulted in concrete actions and heightened oversight on OpenAI, with several having implications for how AI should be regulated.\n====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================\n\n\"The continued global focus on regulating AI products such as ChatGPT only emphasizes the need for immediate action from the FTC,\" said Marc Rotenberg, Executive Director for CAIDP. \"While other countries have taken swift action, the FTC has yet to acknowledge the first complaint made by CAIDP, raising concerns about the agency's ability to address the pressing issues that are emerging from the rapidly evolving AI industry.\"\n============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================\n\nIn response to mounting concerns over the ethical implications and the regulatory needs of such AI products,regulatory agencies in Italy, Canada, France, Australia, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, the U.K., and Japan, have initiated investigations and legal proceedings against OpenAI.\n==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================\n\nThe supplement to the original CAIDP complaint outlines these international efforts, sheds light on newly surfaced issues not fully captured in the initial complaint, such as risks to democracy, and calls attention to statements by FTC Commissioners that the agency would act to safeguard consumers from the harms of unregulated AI products.\n=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================\n\nWith growing public support for AI product regulation, expert opinions, bipartisan AI legislation proposed by the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and President Biden's calls for ensuring product safety before public deployment, CAIDP reaffirms its commitment to pressuring the FTC for urgent intervention.\n=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================\n\n[**CAIDP Supplement, In the Matter of Open AI (July 10, 2023)**](https://www.caidp.org/app/download/8466615863/CAIDP-FTC-Supplement-OpenAI-07102023.pdf?t=1725365713 \"CAIDP-FTC-Supplement-OpenAI-07102023.pdf\")\n\n* * *\n\n### CAIDP's Randolph Asks FTC Commissioners about Status of Open AI Complaint (May 18, 2023)\n\n![Image 4](https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=286x1024:format=jpg/path/s899a9742c3d83292/image/ifde299012d481bd1/version/1685198984/image.jpg)\n\n*   On May 18, 2023, CAIDP Fellow Christabel Randolph spoke at the [FTC Open Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events/2023/05/open-commission-meeting-may-18-2023 \"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events/2023/05/open-commission-meeting-may-18-2023\") Meeting. Ms. Randolph reminded Commissioners Kahn, Slaughter, and Bedoya about the CAIDP complaint. From the[transcript](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/ftc-open-commission-meeting-may-18th-23.pdf \"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/ftc-open-commission-meeting-may-18th-23.pdf\"): \n\n_I'm here today to ask about the status of the CAIDP complaint concerning OpenAI. To date, we have not even received an acknowledgement. Have you opened the investigation we requested? If you have not opened the investigation, can you tell us whether you will and if you don't, can you explain why? The FTC has previously made such announcements, for example, announcing the opening of Facebook investigation after Cambridge Analytical. So we expect and we request a response from the FTC about what actions will be taken on our complaint._\n\n* * *\n\n### Chronology of the CAIDP FTC Complaint\n\n*   On March 6, 2023, CAIDPs' **Marc Rotenberg** and **Merve Hickok** published a [letter](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/06/opinion/letters/alex-murdaugh.html#link-7f9159ab \"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/06/opinion/letters/alex-murdaugh.html#link-7f9159ab\") in The New York Times _\"Regulating AI: The US Needs to Act._\" They wrote, \"The recent coverage of Washington’s response to artificial intelligence is a welcome shift toward an overdue policy debate. But the challenge ahead is not so much about educating lawmakers about new technology as it is about establishing the necessary safeguards to protect the public.\" \n\n*   On March 8, 2023, CAIDP's **Merve Hickok**[testified](https://www.caidp.org/events/in-congress-house-oversight/ \"In Congress (House Oversight)\") before the U.S. Congress. She stated, \"We do not have the guardrails in place, the laws that we need, the public education, or the expertise in government to manage the consequences of the rapid changes that are now taking place.\" \n\n*   On March 20, 2023, **Merve Hickok** and **Marc Rotenberg**, wrote a public letter, stating that CAIDP will file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, \"calling for an investigation of Open AI and the product chatGPT.\" They explained, \"We believe the FTC has the authority to act in this matter and is uniquely positioned as the lead consumer protection agency in the United States to address this emerging challenge. We will ask the FTC to establish a moratorium on the release of further commercial versions of GPT until appropriate safeguards are established.\" \n\n*   On March 30, 2023, CAIDP filed a 46-page c[omplaint](https://www.caidp.org/app/download/8450269463/CAIDP-FTC-Complaint-OpenAI-GPT-033023.pdf?t=1681139856 \"CAIDP-FTC-Complaint-OpenAI-GPT-033023.pdf\") with the Federal Trade Commission. The Center asked the Commission to begin an investigation of OpenAI and to prevent the release of further models until necessary guardrails are established.

Yet less than a few years on, we appear to be approaching a tipping point with the release of Generative AI techniques, which are neither human-centric nor trustworthy._\n\n_These systems produce results that cannot be replicated or proven. They fabricate and hallucinate. They describe how to commit terrorist acts, how to assassinate political leaders, and how to conceal child abuse. GPT-4 has the ability to undertake mass surveillance at scale, combining the ability to ingest images, link to identities, and develop comprehensive profiles._\n\n_As this industry has rapidly evolved so too has the secrecy surrounding the products. The latest technical paper on GPT-4 provides little information about the training data, the number of parameters, or the assessment methods. A fundamental requirement in all emerging AI policy frameworks – an independent impact assessment prior to deployment – was never undertaken._\n\n_Many leading AI experts, including many companies themselves, have called for regulation. Yet there is little effort in the United States today to develop regulatory responses even as countries around the world race to establish legal safeguards._\n\n_The present course cannot be sustained. The public needs more information about the impact of artificial intelligence. Independent experts need the opportunity to interrogate these models. Laws should be enacted to promote algorithmic transparency and counter algorithmic bias. There should be a national commission established to assess the impact of AI on American Society, to better understand the benefits as well as the risks._\n\n_This week the Center for AI and Digital Policy, joined by others, will file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, calling for an investigation of Open AI and the product chatGPT. We believe the FTC has the authority to act in this matter and is uniquely positioned as the lead consumer protection agency in the United States to address this emerging challenge. We will ask the FTC to establish a moratorium on the release of further commercial versions of GPT until appropriate safeguards are established. We will simultaneously petition the FTC to undertake a rulemaking for the regulation of the generative AI industry._\n\n_We favor growth and innovation. We recognize a wide range of opportunities and benefits that AI may provide. But unless we are able to maintain control of these systems, we will be unable to manage the risk that will result or the catastrophic outcomes that may emerge. We are asking the FTC to “hit the pause button” so that there is an opportunity for our institutions, our laws, and our society to catch up. We need to assert agency over the technologies we create before we lose control._\n\nMerve Hickock and Marc Rotenberg\n\nFor the CAIDP\n\n* * *\n\n![Image 7](https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/none/path/s899a9742c3d83292/image/ic22fae814899e244/version/1679513543/image.png)\n\n* * *\n\nThe FTC and AI Policy\n---------------------\n\n_Over the last several years, the FTC has issued several reports and policy guidelines concerning marketing and advertising of AI-relate products and services. We believe that OpenAI should be required by the FTC to comply with these guidelines._\n\n* * *\n\n### FTC Keep your AI claims in check (2023)\n\n_When you talk about AI in your advertising, the FTC may be wondering, among other things:_\n\n*   Are you exaggerating what your AI product can do?\n*   Are you promising that your AI product does something better than a non-AI product? \n*   Are you aware of the risks? \n*   Does the product actually use AI at all? \n\n[[More information](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/02/keep-your-ai-claims-check \"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/02/keep-your-ai-claims-check\")]\n\n* * *\n\n### Aiming for truth, fairness, and equity in your company’s use of AI (2021)\n\nIn 2021, the FTC warned that advances in Artificial Intelligence \"has highlighted how apparently “neutral” technology can produce troubling outcomes – including discrimination by race or other legally protected classes.\" The FTC explained it has decades of experience enforcing three laws important to developers and users of AI:\n\n*   Section 5 of the FTC Act \n*   Fair Credit Reporting Act \n*   Equal Credit Opportunity Act \n\nThe FTC said its recent work on AI – coupled with FTC enforcement actions – offers important lessons on using AI truthfully, fairly, and equitably.\n\n*   Start with the right foundation \n*   Watch out for discriminatory outcomes \n*   Embrace transparency and independenc \n*   Don’t exaggerate what your algorithm can do or whether it can deliver fair or unbiased results \n*   Tell the truth about how you use data \n*   Do more good than harm \n*   Hold yourself accountable – or be ready for the FTC to do it for you \n\n[[More information](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2021/04/aiming-truth-fairness-equity-your-companys-use-ai \"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2021/04/aiming-truth-fairness-equity-your-companys-use-ai\")]\n\n* * *\n\n### Using Artificial Intelligence and Algorithm (2020)\n\n_\" . . . we at the FTC have long experience dealing with the challenges presented by the use of data and algorithms to make decisions about consumers. Over the years, the FTC has brought many cases alleging violations of the laws we enforce involving AI and automated decision-making, and have investigated numerous companies in this space._\n\n_\"The FTC’s law enforcement actions, studies, and guidance emphasize that the use of AI tools should be transparent, explainable, fair, and empirically sound, while fostering accountability. We believe that our experience, as well as existing laws, can offer important lessons about how companies can manage the consumer protection risks of AI and algorithms.\"_\n\n*   _Be transparent._\n*       *   Don’t deceive consumers about how you use automated tools \n    *   Be transparent when collecting sensitive data \n    *   If you make automated decisions based on information from a third-party vendor, you may be required to provide the consumer with an “adverse action” notice \n\n*   Explain your decision to the consumer. \n*       *   If you deny consumers something of value based on algorithmic decision-making, explain why \n    *   If you use algorithms to assign risk scores to consumers, also disclose the key factors that affected the score, rank ordered for importance \n    *   If you might change the terms of a deal based on automated tools, make sure to tell consumers. \n\n*   Ensure that your decisions are fair. \n*       *   Don’t discriminate based on protected classes. \n    *   Focus on inputs, but also on outcomes \n    *   Give consumers access and an opportunity to correct information used to make decisions about them \n\n*   Ensure that your data and models are robust and empirically sound. \n*   Hold yourself accountable for compliance, ethics, fairness, and nondiscrimination. \n\n* * *\n\n### FTC Report to Congress (2022)\n\n**FTC Report Warns About Using Artificial Intelligence to Combat Online Problems**\n\n_**Agency Concerned with AI Harms Such As Inaccuracy, Bias, Discrimination, and Commercial Surveillance Creep (June 16, 2022)**_\n\n_Today the Federal Trade Commission issued a report to Congress warning about using artificial intelligence (AI) to combat online problems and urging policymakers to exercise “great caution” about relying on it as a policy solution. The use of AI, particularly by big tech platforms and other companies, comes with limitations and problems of its own. The report outlines significant concerns that AI tools can be inaccurate, biased, and discriminatory by design and incentivize relying on increasingly invasive forms of commercial surveillance._\n\n* * *\n\nFTC Judgements Concerning AI Practices\n--------------------------------------\n\n* * *\n\nOn March 4, 2022, the Federal Trade Commission announced the settlement of a case against a company that had improperly collected children's data.

Since then, OpenAI, the $29 billion, Microsoft-backed creator of ChatGPT, has gone on a global charm [offensive](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/07/technology/sam-altman-ai-regulations.html) to influence the future of AI policy.\n\nDespite the rapid proliferation of ChatGPT and other generative AI applications, little has been done at the federal level to rein in the technology. In July, however, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) opened an investigation into OpenAI. According to a 20-page [civil investigative demand](https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/67a7081c-c770-4f05-a39e-9d02117e50e8.pdf) (CID), the FTC is primarily interested in whether the AI company has run afoul of consumer protection laws.\n\nThe FTC has had its sights set on AI for years now—from biased [outputs](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2021/04/aiming-truth-fairness-equity-your-companys-use-ai) to exaggerated marketing [claims](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/02/keep-your-ai-claims-check). The investigation of ChatGPT, however, could represent an unparalleled level of disclosure from AI’s posterchild, which has so far stayed tight-lipped about the development and maintenance of ChatGPT. And although the FTC’s policy is to conduct its investigations on a nonpublic basis, [Section 6(f)](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/mission/enforcement-authority) of the FTC Act authorizes the Commission to “make public from time to time” portions of the information it obtains during investigations, such as when disclosure would serve the public interest.\n\nAmong the FTC’s dozens of questions to OpenAI, most are focused on how the company collects, sources, and retains data, as well as how it trains ChatGPT and evaluates the accuracy and reliability of its outputs, including an explicit [request](https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/67a7081c-c770-4f05-a39e-9d02117e50e8.pdf#page=6) for additional information about OpenAI’s process of “reinforcement learning through human feedback.” The CID also [calls](https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/67a7081c-c770-4f05-a39e-9d02117e50e8.pdf#page=15) on OpenAI to list *all* data sources, including websites, third parties, and data scraping tools.\n\nThe FTC’s investigation specifically [hones](https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/67a7081c-c770-4f05-a39e-9d02117e50e8.pdf#page=2) in on two consumer protection issues: “reputational harm” and “privacy and data security.” From a privacy and data security perspective, the Commission will likely evaluate OpenAI’s data collection practices and data retention policies, such as retaining private consumer information or mitigating prompt injection [risks](https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-prompt-injection-attack-security/).\n\nThe FTC’s interest in OpenAI’s privacy practices is unsurprising. After all, the FTC has [brought](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/topics/protecting-consumer-privacy-security/privacy-security-enforcement) many privacy and data security cases in the past several years, especially against tech companies.\n\nCases involving reputational harm, however, are rare.\n\nWith respect to ChatGPT, the FTC’s interest in reputational harm is probably connected to large language models’ tendency to “[hallucinate](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-hallucination)” or generate false information. A persistent concern about ChatGPT since its launch is whether the AI chatbot could be an engine for [spreading](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/30/23741996/openai-chatgpt-false-information-misinformation-responsibility) misinformation. ChatGPT has fabricated fake news [articles](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/06/ai-chatgpt-guardian-technology-risks-fake-article), scientific research [papers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/01/10/fake-scientific-abstracts-written-by-chatgpt-fooled-scientists-study-finds/?sh=715e0f6b18b6), and even judicial [decisions](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/27/23739913/chatgpt-ai-lawsuit-avianca-airlines-chatbot-research).\n\nIn June 2023, for example, ChatGPT’s hallucination resulted in a defamation [lawsuit](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/openai-hit-with-first-defamation-suit-over-chatgpt-hallucination) against OpenAI when it allegedly spread false information about a Georgia radio host, accusing him of embezzling money. Accordingly, reputational harm may be a pathway for the FTC to assess OpenAI’s retraining and refining process as it relates to AI hallucinations as well as procedures for addressing outputs that [make](https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/67a7081c-c770-4f05-a39e-9d02117e50e8.pdf#page=2) “false, misleading, disparaging, or harmful statements” about individuals.\n\nAlthough there is understandably plenty of excitement around what the investigation into OpenAI will reveal, the investigation has already provided a preview of what AI issues are top of mind for the FTC. The results of this investigation will offer a glimpse into how large language models, and AI technology more broadly, fit into the FTC’s consumer protection framework, particularly through the agency’s “unfair or deceptive acts or practices” lens. In fact, the CID as a standalone document [provides](https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/67a7081c-c770-4f05-a39e-9d02117e50e8.pdf) a high-level checklist of AI governance practices that likely align with the FTC’s regulatory expectations. The demand document effectively puts other AI companies on notice by outlining what practices and procedures should be in place.\n\nThe United States [lags](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/13/artificial-intelligence-us-regulation) behind other countries in AI regulation, especially when it comes to privacy risks associated with the technology. The FTC’s investigation into OpenAI is now the best opportunity to establish guardrails for AI products. The FTC has the authority to impose monetary penalties, but the agency is also empowered to establish requirements to prevent companies from engaging in unfair or deceptive practices.\n\nFor example, the FTC’s 2019 [settlement](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2019/07/ftc-imposes-5-billion-penalty-sweeping-new-privacy-restrictions-facebook) with Facebook not only [imposed](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2019/07/ftc-imposes-5-billion-penalty-sweeping-new-privacy-restrictions-facebook) a historic $5 billion penalty but imposed new privacy requirements, such as exercising greater oversight over third-party apps and implementing a data security program. Similarly, in a [settlement](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/06/ftc-finalizes-order-flo-health-fertility-tracking-app-shared-sensitive-health-data-facebook-google) with [Flo Health Inc.,](https://flo.health/) the creator of a period- and fertility-tracking app that reportedly sold sensitive health data to third parties like Facebook and Google, the FTC [required](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/06/ftc-finalizes-order-flo-health-fertility-tracking-app-shared-sensitive-health-data-facebook-google) the company to notify its users about the disclosure of their health information and instruct third parties that received users’ health information to destroy that data.\n\nOpening an investigation does not automatically result in important revelations. Still, this is the closest the public has gotten to peeking behind the curtain of ChatGPT. Depending on how the investigation into OpenAI unfolds, the result could provide an operationalized framework for algorithmic transparency in the United States.\n\nUltimately, the FTC investigation is a welcome development, particularly when compared to the slower response from U.S. lawmakers, who have voiced challenges in balancing innovation and regulation. Unless we are prepared to have history [repeat](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/25/1072177/a-cambridge-analytica-style-scandal-for-ai-is-coming/) itself, innovation should not come at the expense of consumer safety.\n\n[*Patrick K.

Sign up for[WhatMatters](https://calmatters.org/subscribe-to-calmatters/whatmatters)to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State._\n\nAs part of what it described as an ongoing investigation, the California attorney general’s office has sought answers from OpenAI about its reported plan to convert to a for-profit corporation and how it intends to transfer assets out of its existing nonprofit.\n\n[In a letter sent to the ChatGPT maker](https://calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Letter-to-OpenAI-Inc-.pdf) Dec. 6, deputy attorney general Christopher Lamerdin cited clauses in OpenAI’s articles of incorporation under which “OpenAI’s assets are irrevocably dedicated to its charitable purpose,” as Lamerdin put it, as well as the office’s “responsibility to protect assets held in charitable trust.” In addition to asking about asset transfers, it sought information on OpenAI’s restructuring plan and the value of its assets.\n\nThe attorney’s general’s office told CalMatters in an email, “The Department of Justice is committed to protecting charitable assets for their intended purpose and takes this responsibility seriously.”\n\nThe letter asked for a response from OpenAI by Jan. 8. Asked if the attorney general received such a response, a spokesperson wrote, “To protect its integrity, we’re unable to comment on an ongoing investigation.”\n\n> The Department of Justice is committed to protecting charitable assets for their intended purpose and takes this responsibility seriously.\n> \n> Office of Attorney General Rob Bonta\n\nOpenAI did not answer questions on the record about the letter or its structure as an organization.\n\nAllowing nonprofit OpenAI to repurpose its assets to earn a profit and attract investors could set a dangerous precedent, critics argue, allowing startups to enjoy the tax writeoffs of nonprofits even when they intend to eventually become highly lucrative, capitalist enterprises.\n\nThe debate over OpenAI’s business restructure comes at a time when the company is attempting to grow its influence. OpenAI increased spending on [lobbying Congress sevenfold](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/21/1110260/openai-ups-its-lobbying-efforts-nearly-seven-fold/) last year, and for the [first time hired lobbyists](https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2024/09/california-ai-safety-regulations-bills/) to oppose bills to regulate AI in Sacramento.\n\n1.

In November, Bloomberg [reported that OpenAI was in talks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-04/openai-in-talks-with-california-to-become-for-profit-company) with California’s attorney general over the shift.\n\nThe company [confirmed at the end of December](https://openai.com/index/why-our-structure-must-evolve-to-advance-our-mission/) that it was considering a new structure and planned to set up a for-profit public benefit corporation, although it stopped short of saying it planned to move control into the for-profit entity.\n\nOpenAI was founded in late 2015 with the backing of “[PayPal Mafia](https://fortune.com/article/paypal-mafia/)” members like LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Originally a nonprofit focused on benefiting humanity through research into [artificial general intelligence](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-artificial-general-intelligence), it created [four years later](https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-launches-new-company-for-funding-safe-artificial-general-intelligence/) a for-profit arm to appear more attractive to investors and pour billions of dollars into computing resources in order to train powerful AI systems. Profits flowing to that part of the company and its investors are [understood to be capped, creating a barrier](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-complex-path-to-becoming-a-for-profit-company-bad21a42) to fundraising. A dispute between the nonprofit and for-profit arms of OpenAI broke into the open in late 2023 following an [effort by the nonprofit board](https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-board-fired-sam-altman-dd6a15228fd11aa3b9bec2914c095271) to oust co-founder and CEO Sam Altman, which led to an ultimatum from a majority of employees, who threatened to quit if Altman was not reinstated.\n\nSince then, OpenAI closed a $6.6 billion funding round and, earlier this week, alongside President Trump in the White House, announced the [Stargate Project](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/), a $500 billion joint venture to build data centers and energy infrastructure that companies like OpenAI say is necessary to train large AI models.\n\n![Image 4: A group of individuals standing on a stage, dressed in formal attire, with one person holding a microphone and speaking.

Photo by Bryan R. Smith, Pool Photo via AP Photo\n\nCalifornia’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, on Dec. 12 was urged in a letter from [Meta to stop OpenAI from becoming a for-profit company](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/elon-musk-open-ai-lawsuit-response-c1f415f8), according to the Wall Street Journal, with Meta arguing that such a precedent could have “seismic implications for Silicon Valley” by allowing startups to enjoy privileged nonprofit tax status until they begin making money. Musk has [sought to block the conversion](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/elon-musk-asks-court-to-block-openai-conversion-from-nonprofit-to-for-profit/) as part of a lawsuit against OpenAI [filed last summer](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/05/elon-musk-sues-openai-sam-altman).\n\nAfter the OpenAI nonprofit board fired Altman in 2023, nonprofit consumer advocacy group Public Citizen repeatedly argued in letters to attorneys general in California, where OpenAI is based, and Delaware, where OpenAI filed articles of incorporation, that they should investigate the organization. Public Citizen Co-President Robert Weissman wrote that OpenAI was not operating like a nonprofit, should lose its nonprofit status and be forced to operate as a for-profit business, and that any for-profit entity assuming control of OpenAI should pay a premium for that control to a nonprofit entirely separate from OpenAI.\n\nThe precedent for this approach comes from Blue Cross of California, which, following a transfer of assets to a for-profit subsidiary in the 1990s, [gave more than $3 billion in stock to two foundations](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2690248/).\n\nMore on big tech in california\n------------------------------\n\n[![Image 5: A mystery surge in California tax revenue points to tech companies like Nvidia.

Here’s why](https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2024/10/ca-corporate-tax-revenue-surge/)\n\nOctober 2, 2024 October 3, 2024\n\nIt’s tough to say precisely how much such a premium is worth when it comes to OpenAI, but a day before OpenAI’s $6 billion funding round last October, Weissman estimated it’s worth [at least $30 billion](https://www.techpolicy.press/to-convert-to-for-profit-status-openai-should-pay-30-billion-share-technology/).\n\nThe Stargate Project, Weissman told CalMatters, “is more evidence that the OpenAI nonprofit doesn’t really exist as an independent body, that the OpenAI nonprofit board is not exerting any meaningful authority over the for profit, and isn’t even taking seriously its nonprofit mission.”\n\nWeissman wants to see the attorney general investigate how much of a premium a for-profit OpenAI would need to pay and how that valuation relates to intellectual property owned by OpenAI and companies and subsidiaries tied to OpenAI.\n\n“The California attorney general’s office is a serious regulator of nonprofits, and there’s no way that this scale spin off from a nonprofit is going to take place without careful review by the California attorney general,” Weissman told CalMatters. “We’re hopeful they arrive at conclusions that track [with] what we’ve been arguing over the last year and a half.”\n\n_Levi Sumagaysay contributed to this story._\n\nMore on regulating AI companies\n-------------------------------\n\n[![Image 6: California’s ‘Trump-proofing’ likely won’t include AI — at least not yet](https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/030824_Border-Surveillance_GETTY_CM_01.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&ssl=1)](https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2024/11/trump-ai-california-regulation-pushback/)\n\n### [California’s ‘Trump-proofing’ likely won’t include AI — at least not yet](https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2024/11/trump-ai-california-regulation-pushback/)\n\nNovember 21, 2024 November 21, 2024\n\n[![Image 7: Why Gavin Newsom vetoed California’s bold bid to regulate AI](https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/091824_Dreamforce_FM_CM_16.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&ssl=1)](https://calmatters.org/economy/2024/09/california-artificial-intelligence-bill-veto/)\n\n### [Why Gavin Newsom vetoed California’s bold bid to regulate AI](https://calmatters.org/economy/2024/09/california-artificial-intelligence-bill-veto/)\n\nSeptember 29, 2024 September 30, 2024\n\nRead more from CalMatters\n\n[![Image 8](https://calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/engage_text_icon.png) Text Get breaking news on your phone.](https://joinsubtext.com/calmatters)[![Image 9](https://calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/engage_download_icon.png) Download Keep up with the latest via our app.](https://urlgeni.us/calmatters-app)[![Image 10](https://calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/engage_subscribe_icon.png) Sign up Receive free updates in your inbox.](https://calmatters.org/subscribe-to-calmatters/)\n\nNonpartisan, independent California news for all\n------------------------------------------------\n\nWe’re CalMatters, your nonprofit and nonpartisan news guide.\n\nOur journalists are here to empower you and our mission continues to be essential.\n\n*   **We are independent and nonpartisan.**Our trustworthy journalism is free from partisan politics, free from corporate influence and actually free for all Californians.\n*   **We are focused on California issues.**From the environment to homelessness, economy and more, we publish the unfettered truth to keep you informed.\n*   **We hold people in power accountable.**We probe and reveal the actions and inactions of powerful people and institutions, and the consequences that follow.\n\nBut we can’t keep doing this without support from readers like you.\n\n![Image 11](https://calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Asset-2ii-2.png)\n******Please give what you can today.

A Boyles Height, Los Angeles, native, he is a board member of The East Los Angeles Community Corporation and Innovate Public Schools.\n\n### Catherine Bracy\n\nCatherine Bracy is the founder and CEO of TechEquity. She is the author of “[World Eaters](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/723091/world-eaters-by-catherine-bracy/),” and previously served as Code for America’s senior director of partnerships and ecosystem.\n\nJust days after [abandoning its planned conversion](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-05-05/openai-says-its-non-profit-will-remain-in-control-of-its-for-profit-business) to a for-profit entity and proclaiming it would remain a nonprofit, OpenAI puzzled us with another announcement: a nearly [$6.5 billion deal to buy io](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/22/nx-s1-5407548/openai-jony-ive-io-deal-ai-devices), a start-up created by former Apple executive and iPhone designer Jony Ive.\n\nThis isn’t the only business deal OpenAI has in the works. The company also [announced plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/technology/openai-uae-data-centers.html) to build a massive new data center in the United Arab Emirates and has [reportedly purchased](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-agrees-buy-windsurf-about-3-billion-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-05-06/) AI startup Windsurf.\n\nIf anyone was under the impression that OpenAI’s decision to remain a nonprofit is a win for the public, its profit-driven business moves should put that to rest. Deals like these, which require OpenAI to sell stakes in the company, erode the nonprofit’s control of the business.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI has still not answered fundamental questions about how their conversion to a public benefit corporation will maintain the nonprofit’s independent oversight. Which of OpenAI’s entities owns the technologies it develops? How will OpenAI avoid conflicts of interest and self-dealing among executives and investors? Who will reap the funds that the for-profit sows? Most of all, what happens when shareholder interests conflict with the public interest that the nonprofit is legally bound to serve?\n\nWithout answers to these critical questions, the [investigations into OpenAI’s structure](https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/01/openai-investigation-california/) by the California and Delaware attorneys general must continue.\n\nOpenAI was originally founded as a nonprofit to ensure artificial intelligence would benefit all of humanity. Today, it is operating under a structure that allows profit and commercial gain to take priority over its mission to serve the public good.\n\nSince 2019, OpenAI has methodically shifted power away from its nonprofit parent organization into a tangled web of [business deals and investor relationships](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-raise-40-billion-softbank-led-new-funding-2025-03-31/). Meanwhile, the nonprofit increasingly plays the role of a weak and passive bystander rather than a steward of the public interest — its assets are largely unaccounted for and its ability to steer AI toward meaningful public benefits is deeply compromised.\n\nOpenAI’s latest pivot is a clever rebranding of its problematic business-as-usual approach. It’s a way to deflect lawsuits, avoid further scrutiny and put the interests of investors ahead of the everyday people OpenAI is legally required to serve.\n\n## Read Next\n\n[Technology](https://calmatters.org/category/economy/technology/)\n\n### [California is investigating OpenAI’s conversion to a for-profit company](https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/01/openai-investigation-california/)\n\nby [Khari Johnson](https://calmatters.org/author/khari-johnson/)\n\nThe public deserves answers and transparency. While disputes over governance structures and the legalities of nonprofit ownership may seem tedious and disconnected from the lives of everyday people, OpenAI’s future has huge implications for the well-being of society.\n\nOn the one hand, artificial intelligence is leading to breakthroughs that are helping us [adapt to climate change](https://www.forbes.com/sites/heatherwishartsmith/2025/04/01/how-ai-is-transforming-climate-change-prediction-and-mitigation/), [detect deadly diseases](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03714-7) and simply give us more time back in our busy lives. On the opposite end, the technology is also [accelerating greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/ai-climate-toll-imf-study), while leading to [wrongful incarceration](https://innocenceproject.org/news/artificial-intelligence-is-putting-innocent-people-at-risk-of-being-incarcerated/), [unemployment](https://www.wsj.com/articles/it-unemployment-rises-to-5-7-as-ai-hits-tech-jobs-7726bb1b) and [worldwide misinformation](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ai-image-misinformation-surged-google-research-finds-rcna154333).\n\nIn OpenAI’s own [founding words](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai/): “It’s hard to fathom how much human-level AI could benefit society, and it’s equally hard to imagine how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly.” If OpenAI’s charitable assets were separated from its commercial interests and put into the hands of a fully independent nonprofit that can carry out its original mission, there is a much better chance of ensuring the positive future vision for AI than the negative.\n\nThat’s why the attorneys general of California and Delaware need to take decisive action in their ongoing [investigations into OpenAI’s restructuring](https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-nonprofit-aad1fddb75a19008a1a349d1c972d476). There must be robust investigation and oversight of OpenAI’s governance structure, including a review of past compliance with California charitable law. All nonprofit assets unrelated to governance should be fairly valued and required to transfer to a new, fully independent charitable entity dedicated to maximizing public benefit. Lastly, the nonprofit board needs true independence and ongoing oversight power to hold OpenAI accountable.\n\nOpenAI started as a nonprofit, which means it must serve the public good, not private interests. Yet for years, OpenAI has been using those charitable assets for commercial purposes, violating its mission. There must be a clear separation. That’s what OpenAI promised when it started, and it’s what the public deserves.\n\n## Read More\n\n[Higher Education](https://calmatters.org/category/education/higher-education/)\n\n### [Costly and unreliable: AI and plagiarism detectors wreak havoc in higher ed](https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/06/ai-detector/)\n\n[Technology](https://calmatters.org/category/economy/technology/)\n\n### [State claims there’s zero high-risk AI in California government—despite ample evidence to the contrary](https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/05/california-somehow-finds-no-ai-risks/)\n\n###### Republish\n\n### Why California’s attorney general must continue the investigation into OpenAI\n\nWe love that you want to share our stories with your readers.

This upgrade transforms ChatGPT from a static chatbot into a **proactive AI assistant** that can **think and act on a user’s behalf**[openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-agent/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=You%20can%20now%20ask%20ChatGPT,spreadsheets%20that%20summarize%20its%20findings)[openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-agent/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Most%20importantly%2C%20you%E2%80%99re%20always%20in,stop%20tasks%20at%20any%20point).

Notably, early benchmarks show it achieved state-of-the-art performance on broad reasoning tests (e.g. a 41.6% score on the challenging “Humanity’s Last Exam” benchmark, beating previous models) [cybernews.com](https://cybernews.com/ai-news/openais-new-chatgpt-agent-can-handle-your-daily-tasks/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=The%20model%E2%80%99s%20capabilities%20are%20reflected,4). _“I think 2025 is the year we go from ChatGPT being a super smart thing that can answer questions to ChatGPT **doing** things in the real world,”_ one tech executive remarked, capturing the industry’s excitement [em360tech.com](https://em360tech.com/tech-articles/openais-chatgpt-agent-rollout-triggers-urgent-privacy-warnings?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=OpenAI%27s%20ChatGPT%20Agent%20Rollout%20Triggers,autonomy%20reaches%20a%20new).\n\n**Safety First, Even on the Cutting Edge:** Alongside the fanfare, OpenAI has been candid that this **powerful new agent comes with new risks**. By giving ChatGPT the ability to take actions (like writing code or browsing the web), the system could potentially be misused or make mistakes with real-world consequences. _“We can’t anticipate everything,”_ CEO Sam Altman admitted, stressing that the feature is **“cutting edge and experimental”** and _“not something I’d yet use for high-stakes [tasks] or with a lot of personal information”_[cybernews.com](https://cybernews.com/ai-news/openais-new-chatgpt-agent-can-handle-your-daily-tasks/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20have%20built%20a%20lot,in%20a%20post%20on%20X). OpenAI published a detailed _“ChatGPT Agent System Card”_ outlining safeguards put in place. These include automatic refusals or secondary reviews for dangerous prompts (especially related to chemical or biological weapons), real-time monitoring of the agent’s actions, and requiring user confirmation before any high-impact step [inkl.com](https://www.inkl.com/news/openai-classifies-chatgpt-agent-as-high-bio-risk-strengthens-safety-measures-to-prevent-abuse?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=In%20response%20to%20identified%20risks%2C,risk%20topics)[inkl.com](https://www.inkl.com/news/openai-classifies-chatgpt-agent-as-high-bio-risk-strengthens-safety-measures-to-prevent-abuse?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=All%20prompts%20and%20actions%20are,and%20initiates%20a%20secondary%20review). **Internal safety researchers even decided to classify the agent as a “High Risk” model in the bio/chemistry domain** under OpenAI’s risk framework – the first time any OpenAI model has received that designation [openai.com](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-agent-system-card/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=We%20have%20decided%20to%20treat,to%20take%20a%20precautionary%20approach)[inkl.com](https://www.inkl.com/news/openai-classifies-chatgpt-agent-as-high-bio-risk-strengthens-safety-measures-to-prevent-abuse?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=OpenAI%20has%20officially%20classified%20its,of%20biological%20or%20chemical%20weapons).\n\nWhy such caution? Early testing showed the agent could potentially lower the barrier for novices to find harmful information (for instance, by **bridging the gap between general web info and “actionable” expert guidance in biology**) [inkl.com](https://www.inkl.com/news/openai-classifies-chatgpt-agent-as-high-bio-risk-strengthens-safety-measures-to-prevent-abuse?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=true%20today). _“Some might think that biorisk is not real, and models only provide information you could find via search. That may have been true in 2024, but it is definitely not true today,”_ warned OpenAI’s Boaz Barak, a technical staff member, emphasizing how much more capable the new agent is [inkl.com](https://www.inkl.com/news/openai-classifies-chatgpt-agent-as-high-bio-risk-strengthens-safety-measures-to-prevent-abuse?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Boaz%20Barak%2C%20a%20member%20of,is%20definitely%20not%20true%20today). In response, OpenAI **partnered with biosecurity experts and red-teamers to stress-test** the system prior to launch [inkl.com](https://www.inkl.com/news/openai-classifies-chatgpt-agent-as-high-bio-risk-strengthens-safety-measures-to-prevent-abuse?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=External%20Collaboration%20and%20Oversight), and built in **multiple layers of safety**: the agent will actively block any prompts related to bioweapons or illicit behavior, limit the rate of potentially risky requests, and even allow human moderators to “take over” the agent if needed [inkl.com](https://www.inkl.com/news/openai-classifies-chatgpt-agent-as-high-bio-risk-strengthens-safety-measures-to-prevent-abuse?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=In%20response%20to%20identified%20risks%2C,risk%20topics)[inkl.com](https://www.inkl.com/news/openai-classifies-chatgpt-agent-as-high-bio-risk-strengthens-safety-measures-to-prevent-abuse?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=To%20further%20guard%20against%20abuse%2C,lacking%20the%20necessary%20scientific%20background). _“A layered defence is the only way to balance innovation and safety at this level,”_ an OpenAI spokesperson said, noting the company’s commitment to responsible deployment [inkl.com](https://www.inkl.com/news/openai-classifies-chatgpt-agent-as-high-bio-risk-strengthens-safety-measures-to-prevent-abuse?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=%27A%20layered%20defence%20is%20the,users%20while%20preventing%20harmful%20misuse).\n\nIndustry experts have been quick to weigh in on this milestone. Many see ChatGPT Agent as **heralding a new era of AI “co-pilots”** that can actually execute tasks rather than just advise. _“It’s wild watching people use ChatGPT…knowing what’s coming,”_ one OpenAI insider teased, hinting at even greater things on the horizon [medium.com](https://medium.com/@larryatkins/great-article-e11d76c6dc1c?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Larry%20Atkins%20,%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%94%20OpenAI%20insider). At the same time, AI safety researchers note that OpenAI’s candid approach – treating their new Agent as _“high risk”_ and baking in unprecedented safeguards – could set a **new standard for transparency and caution** in the industry [inkl.com](https://www.inkl.com/news/openai-classifies-chatgpt-agent-as-high-bio-risk-strengthens-safety-measures-to-prevent-abuse?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=OpenAI%20has%20officially%20classified%20its,of%20biological%20or%20chemical%20weapons)[inkl.com](https://www.inkl.com/news/openai-classifies-chatgpt-agent-as-high-bio-risk-strengthens-safety-measures-to-prevent-abuse?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=OpenAI%27s%20internal%20safety%20researchers%20flagged,in%20carrying%20out%20harmful%20actions). All told, the release of ChatGPT Agent in July 2025 marks a defining moment: AI systems are no longer just responding to our questions, they are _starting to take actions on our behalf_ – and the world is watching closely to see how that unfolds.\n\nDALL·E and Beyond: OpenAI’s Generative AI Grows Multimodal (Enter **Sora**)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOpenAI’s generative AI push isn’t limited to text and images – it’s now venturing boldly into video. **Sora**, OpenAI’s long-anticipated _text-to-video_ model, became widely available to users this summer as part of ChatGPT’s premium plans [techfundingnews.com](https://techfundingnews.com/openai-sora-ai-video-generation-launch/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=OpenAI%20has%20officially%20launched%20Sora%2C,for%20Plus%20and%20Pro%20users)[techfundingnews.com](https://techfundingnews.com/openai-sora-ai-video-generation-launch/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=market,for%20Plus%20and%20Pro%20users). Sora allows users to input a text description (and optionally images or video clips) and receive a **high-definition short video clip** as output [techfundingnews.com](https://techfundingnews.com/openai-sora-ai-video-generation-launch/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=OpenAI%20has%20officially%20launched%20Sora%2C,for%20Plus%20and%20Pro%20users). Creators can, for example, type _“a cowboy astronaut explores a jungle that turns into the moon”_ and watch Sora generate that scene as a dynamic video. The tool can also **blend two different video scenes seamlessly, fill in missing frames** between shots, and apply stylistic transformations (e.g. making footage look like a papercraft animation) – all powered by advanced generative AI [techfundingnews.com](https://techfundingnews.com/openai-sora-ai-video-generation-launch/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=video%20clip.%20The%20Microsoft,for%20Plus%20and%20Pro%20users)[techfundingnews.com](https://techfundingnews.com/openai-sora-ai-video-generation-launch/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Sora%E2%80%99s%20debut%20builds%20on%20OpenAI%E2%80%99s,for%20creating%20endlessly%20repeating%20videos).\n\nThough OpenAI **officially “launched” Sora late last year**, July 2025 is the first time it’s broadly available to the public as a built-in feature of ChatGPT Plus and Pro (at no extra cost) [techfundingnews.com](https://techfundingnews.com/openai-sora-ai-video-generation-launch/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=OpenAI%20has%20officially%20launched%20Sora%2C,for%20Plus%20and%20Pro%20users)[techfundingnews.com](https://techfundingnews.com/openai-sora-ai-video-generation-launch/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=market,for%20Plus%20and%20Pro%20users). _“Sora lets users type a description of a scene and receive a high-definition video clip,”_ one report noted, calling it a _“cutting-edge AI video-generation tool”_ that could redefine creative content creation [techfundingnews.com](https://techfundingnews.com/openai-sora-ai-video-generation-launch/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=OpenAI%20has%20officially%20launched%20Sora%2C,for%20Plus%20and%20Pro%20users). **Plus users can now generate up to 10-second, 720p videos**, while Pro subscribers get 1080p clips up to 20 seconds, with faster generation and even watermark-free downloads for professional use [openai.com](https://openai.com/sora/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=ChatGPT%20Plus)[openai.com](https://openai.com/sora/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=ChatGPT%20Pro). In integrating Sora, OpenAI signals that _multimodal AI_ – AI that understands and generates not just text, but images, audio, and video – is now a core part of its strategy. _“Sora’s debut builds on OpenAI’s ambition to master multimodality,”_ CEO Sam Altman said during a livestream demo, highlighting features like a “Blend” mode for merging scenes and a “Loop” mode for creating infinitely looping videos [techfundingnews.com](https://techfundingnews.com/openai-sora-ai-video-generation-launch/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Redefining%20creativity%20with%20multimodal%20AI,generation). This moves OpenAI beyond ChatGPT’s chat box and DALL·E’s images into the realm of full video creation, positioning them strongly in what many see as _the next frontier of generative AI_.\n\n**Competitive Landscape:** OpenAI isn’t alone in chasing AI-driven video generation. In fact, the launch of Sora comes amid _fierce competition from other AI labs_ – an AI arms race not just in text and images, but now video. Google, for instance, has been developing an internal tool called **“Lumiere”** for AI video, and startups like **Stability AI** (known for Stable Diffusion) have previewed **“Stable Video Diffusion”** models [techfundingnews.com](https://techfundingnews.com/openai-sora-ai-video-generation-launch/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Sora%E2%80%99s%20release%20comes%20as%20OpenAI,Video%20Diffusion%20competing%20for%20attention). Meta and others are also investing in multimodal AI. By releasing Sora to the public via ChatGPT, OpenAI has arguably leapt ahead in this video generation race, offering a polished product to millions of users. _“Video generation is emerging as the next frontier in AI,”_ observed Tech Funding News, noting that **OpenAI’s rivals (Google, Meta, Stability)** are right on its heels [techfundingnews.com](https://techfundingnews.com/openai-sora-ai-video-generation-launch/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Sora%E2%80%99s%20release%20comes%20as%20OpenAI,Video%20Diffusion%20competing%20for%20attention). OpenAI’s advantage, for now, is integrating Sora directly into an ecosystem (ChatGPT) that users and developers are already using – lowering the barrier for widespread adoption of AI-generated video.\n\n**Challenges and Controversy:** The rollout hasn’t been without hiccups. **Notably, Sora remains unavailable in Europe and the UK** as of July, with OpenAI citing a lack of a timeline for EU/UK release while they work through _“legal and safety standards”_[techfundingnews.com](https://techfundingnews.com/openai-sora-ai-video-generation-launch/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=for%20vulnerabilities). Many interpret this as OpenAI treading carefully in light of Europe’s upcoming AI regulations (the EU AI Act, set to enforce strict rules on generative AI in 2025). Additionally, Sora’s development phase saw some **pushback from the creative community**. In late 2024, protesters leaked an early Sora model and some artists in the beta program penned an open letter accusing OpenAI of _“exploiting unpaid labour”_ and lacking transparency with those testers [techfundingnews.com](https://techfundingnews.com/openai-sora-ai-video-generation-launch/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Controversy%20brews%20over%20artist%20relations). _“Dear corporate AI overlords,”_ the frustrated letter began, highlighting tensions between tech companies and artists concerned about being marginalized by AI [techfundingnews.com](https://techfundingnews.com/openai-sora-ai-video-generation-launch/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=While%20Sora%20represents%20an%20innovation,benefiting%20from%20substantial%20PR%20value). OpenAI responded by emphasizing the **safeguards against misuse** built into Sora (to prevent things like deepfake impersonations or misinformation videos [techfundingnews.com](https://techfundingnews.com/openai-sora-ai-video-generation-launch/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=OpenAI%20CEO%20Sam%20Altman%2C%20during,for%20creating%20endlessly%20repeating%20videos)) and by pointing to their engagement with creators (the company showcased **use cases by artists and filmmakers** using Sora creatively [openai.com](https://openai.com/sora/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Finding%20new%20ways%20to%20create)). Nevertheless, the incident underscored the need for OpenAI to build trust with the artistic community as it introduces these powerful generative tools.\n\nOverall, Sora’s public debut in the ChatGPT platform is a **significant leap for generative AI** – expanding the medium from text and images to full-motion video. It empowers users to _“bring imagination to life”_ in entirely new ways, whether you’re a filmmaker prototyping a scene or just a hobbyist animating your ideas. As one creative director put it, _“It feels like having a tiny movie studio at your command – you describe it, and it visualizes it”_. With OpenAI continuing to refine Sora (and promising even longer and higher-resolution videos in the future), the line between human creativity and AI assistance in video production is blurring fast.\n\nA $6.5 _Billion_ Bet on AI Hardware – OpenAI Merges with Jony Ive’s Team\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne of the most buzzed-about developments in July was OpenAI’s bold move into hardware, **partnering with legendary Apple designer Jony Ive**. On July 9, OpenAI officially confirmed that it has **acquired Ive’s startup “io Products, Inc.”** – a two-year-old design firm focused on AI devices – in a deal reportedly worth nearly **$6.5 billion (in stock)**[theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/news/703114/openai-io-jony-ive-sam-altman-ai-hardware?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=OpenAI%20has%20officially%20closed%20its,startup%20as%20io%20Products%20Inc)[appleinsider.com](https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/07/09/openai-jony-ives-io-products-merger-is-done?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Initially%2C%20it%20was%20reported%20that,higher%20would%20be%20an%20understatement). This eye-popping deal brings Ive (the creative mind behind the iPhone, iMac, and other iconic devices) and his handpicked team of ex-Apple engineers directly into OpenAI’s fold. According to OpenAI’s announcement, _“Jony Ive and [his design firm] LoveFrom remain independent but have assumed deep design and creative responsibilities across OpenAI”_[theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/news/703114/openai-io-jony-ive-sam-altman-ai-hardware?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Now%20it%E2%80%99s%20back%20up%2C%20with,%E2%80%9D). In other words, Jony Ive is now guiding the design vision for OpenAI’s products and future AI interfaces.\n\n**Why this matters:** Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, has often highlighted the need for AI to be paired with great UX and physical form-factors. _“AI is an incredible technology, but great tools require work at the intersection of technology, design, and understanding people and the world. No one can do this like Jony and his team; the amount of care they put into every aspect… is extraordinary,”_ Altman said, explaining the rationale for the partnership [openai.com](https://openai.com/sam-and-jony/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=,Share). The goal is nothing short of reinventing how we interact with AI. **Altman and Ive have teased plans to create a new consumer device** that deeply integrates OpenAI’s generative AI (think ChatGPT’s intelligence) with innovative hardware design [theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/news/703114/openai-io-jony-ive-sam-altman-ai-hardware?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=OpenAI%20has%20officially%20closed%20its,startup%20as%20io%20Products%20Inc)[appleinsider.com](https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/07/09/openai-jony-ives-io-products-merger-is-done?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=The%20final%20sale%20price%20wound,5%20billion%20%E2%80%94%20in%20stock). While they’ve been secretive on specifics, hints have leaked out: _The Verge_ reported that the project is _“to merge ChatGPT’s AI tech with new hardware devices”_, and other insiders speculate it could be a groundbreaking take on a smartphone or wearable [theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/news/703114/openai-io-jony-ive-sam-altman-ai-hardware?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Sam%20Altman%20and%20Jony%20Ive%E2%80%99s,hardware%20devices%20is%20moving%20forward)[appleinsider.com](https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/07/09/openai-jony-ives-io-products-merger-is-done?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=The%20final%20sale%20price%20wound,5%20billion%20%E2%80%94%20in%20stock). One popular rumor is that they’re exploring a **voice-first AI assistant device – essentially _“a phone without a screen,”_** that relies on voice and ambient AI to assist users in daily life [appleinsider.com](https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/07/09/openai-jony-ives-io-products-merger-is-done?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=The%20final%20sale%20price%20wound,5%20billion%20%E2%80%94%20in%20stock). This would be a radically different approach from today’s touch-screen devices, possibly aiming to make AI more seamlessly accessible throughout the day. _The pair believes they’re going to change the way humans interface with technology,_ an AppleInsider report noted, underscoring the ambition at play [appleinsider.com](https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/07/09/openai-jony-ives-io-products-merger-is-done?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=The%20final%20sale%20price%20wound,5%20billion%20%E2%80%94%20in%20stock).\n\n**Inside the deal:** The journey to this merger actually began quietly over two years ago. Ive’s team at LoveFrom started collaborating with OpenAI in 2023 on experimental designs for AI hardware [openai.com](https://openai.com/sam-and-jony/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Two%20years%20ago%2C%20Jony%20Ive,and%20the%20team%20at%20OpenAI). By 2024, Ive had spun up “io Products” with key former Apple colleagues (including Sir Jony’s longtime co-designers Evans Hankey and Tang Tan) specifically to prototype **“new products that inspire, empower, and enable”** new AI experiences [openai.com](https://openai.com/sam-and-jony/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=It%20became%20clear%20that%20our,Evans%20Hankey%20and%20Tang%20Tan). Initially, reports suggested OpenAI might invest around $500 million, but things escalated – SoftBank and other investors got involved, and in the end OpenAI opted to buy out io Products entirely for $6.5B [appleinsider.com](https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/07/09/openai-jony-ives-io-products-merger-is-done?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Evans%20Hankey%20,startup%20collaboration%20with%20Sam%20Altman). The deal did hit a brief snag due to a **trademark dispute** (another company, _Iyo_, obtained a restraining order over the use of the name “io”), which even led OpenAI to temporarily pull down its announcement webpage in June [theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/news/703114/openai-io-jony-ive-sam-altman-ai-hardware?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=The%20blog%20post%20initially%20announcing,out%20of%20Google%E2%80%99s%20moonshot%20factory). But by July, the issue was resolved enough for the announcement to go forward – albeit carefully referring to “io Products, Inc.” in full to avoid confusion [theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/news/703114/openai-io-jony-ive-sam-altman-ai-hardware?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Now%20it%E2%80%99s%20back%20up%2C%20with,%E2%80%9D).\n\nFrom an industry perspective, this union of a top-tier AI company with a top-tier design visionary is unprecedented. It signals that OpenAI _does not intend to remain just a software/API company_, but aims to _shape the consumer experience_ of AI directly. _“The final sale price wound up being nearly $6.5 billion — in stock,”_ one report emphasized, noting how high the stakes are [appleinsider.com](https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/07/09/openai-jony-ives-io-products-merger-is-done?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Initially%2C%20it%20was%20reported%20that,higher%20would%20be%20an%20understatement). For comparison, that’s more than Google paid to acquire Nest or Motorola in the past – highlighting OpenAI’s conviction that future AI breakthroughs need new hardware to live in. Jony Ive himself has expressed both excitement and a sense of responsibility. _“I have a growing sense that everything I have learned over the last 30 years has led me to this moment… I am so grateful for the opportunity to be part of such an important collaboration,”_ Ive said, calling the vision of Sam Altman and the OpenAI team _“a rare inspiration”_[openai.com](https://openai.com/sam-and-jony/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=,Share). Observers expect the first fruits of this partnership to appear in a year or two – and while details are scant, **it’s likely to be a consumer device that reimagines how we use AI daily**, possibly leveraging voice, sensors, and ChatGPT-style smarts in a more pervasive way than a phone app. As one tech commentator wryly noted, _“Hopefully they have better luck than the last startup that tried an AI gadget”_[appleinsider.com](https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/07/09/openai-jony-ives-io-products-merger-is-done?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=it%2C%20it%20seems%20like%20they,of%20creating%20a%20new%20device) – referencing the ill-fated AI Pin device from a startup called Humane. With Ive’s track record and OpenAI’s tech, expectations will be sky-high for whatever they unveil.\n\nOpenAI in the Public Eye: Investments in Communities, Regulatory Hurdles, and Expert Reactions\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt hasn’t all been product launches and partnerships – **July 2025 also saw OpenAI navigating the complex social and regulatory landscape surrounding AI.** Here are the key developments on that front:\n\n**1. Investing in AI for Good:** OpenAI announced a new **$50 million fund to support nonprofit and community projects** that use AI to tackle societal challenges [openai.com](https://openai.com/index/50-million-fund-to-build-with-communities/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=A%20%2450%20million%20fund%20to,build%20with%20communities). Launched on July 18, this fund is a direct response to the findings of an independent _OpenAI Nonprofit Commission_ that convened earlier in the year. That Commission gathered input from over **500 nonprofits and community leaders (representing 7+ million people)** on how AI could help address issues in areas like education, healthcare, and economic inequality [openai.com](https://openai.com/index/50-million-fund-to-build-with-communities/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Yesterday%2C%20the%20independent%20OpenAI%20Nonprofit,Commission%E2%80%99s%20series%20of%20listening%20sessions). The message was clear: frontline organizations need resources and support to leverage AI for public good. OpenAI’s answer is this $50M fund, which will offer grants and assistance to **“frontline and mission-based organizations”** working on problems like **improving education, expanding economic opportunity, community organizing, and healthcare services**[openai.com](https://openai.com/index/50-million-fund-to-build-with-communities/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20why%20today%2C%20we%20are,learn%2C%20and%20build%20with%20community)[openai.com](https://openai.com/index/50-million-fund-to-build-with-communities/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=With%20this%20fund%2C%20we%20will,to%20advance%20the%20public%20good). _“AI should help people solve humanity’s hardest problems, and that includes empowering the organizations on the front lines,”_ the company wrote, stressing that many answers for how AI can best help will come from the communities themselves [openai.com](https://openai.com/index/50-million-fund-to-build-with-communities/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=At%20OpenAI%2C%20we%20believe%20AI,front%20lines%20of%20that%20work)[openai.com](https://openai.com/index/50-million-fund-to-build-with-communities/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=impact%20we%20can%20have%20in,the%20years%20ahead). This move has been widely praised by experts as a positive step – showing OpenAI tying its mission (to ensure AGI benefits all humanity) to concrete action. It’s also notable as one of OpenAI’s first large philanthropic initiatives. (For context, OpenAI started as a nonprofit before transitioning to a capped-profit model, and it still maintains a nonprofit arm meant to focus on long-term beneficial impact [openai.com](https://openai.com/index/nonprofit-commission-report/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=convened%20%E2%81%A0%20by%20OpenAI%20in,reflects%20the%20Commission%E2%80%99s%20independent%20findings)[openai.com](https://openai.com/index/nonprofit-commission-report/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=ensuring%20Artificial%20General%20Intelligence%20benefits,all%20of%20humanity).) By seeding $50M now and promising this is “one early step” toward broader efforts, OpenAI seems keen to demonstrate social responsibility amid the AI race [openai.com](https://openai.com/index/50-million-fund-to-build-with-communities/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=This%20new%20initiative%20builds%20on,have%20in%20the%20years%20ahead).\n\n**2. Delaying an “Open-Source” AI Release:** In a somewhat surprising turn, OpenAI **hit the brakes on releasing a new open-weight AI model** that many in the community were eagerly awaiting. Sam Altman revealed (via a July 12 tweet) that OpenAI _“planned to launch [our] open-weight model next week… [but] we are delaying it”_ in order to **run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas**[techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=,sama%29%20July%2012%2C%202025). The model in question is believed to be a smaller-scale language model that OpenAI intends to open source (or at least release the weights for) – a departure from its usual closed-model approach. It had already been postponed once earlier in the summer, and now the launch has been **indefinitely put on hold pending further review**[techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=,open%20model%20again). _“We are not yet sure how long it will take us,”_ Altman admitted, emphasizing that while OpenAI _“trusts the community will build great things”_ with an open model, they want to ensure it can be released _responsibly_[techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=,sama%29%20July%2012%2C%202025). This cautious stance drew a mixed reaction. Many open-source AI enthusiasts are disappointed by the delay, as they’re eager to get a powerful new model they can tinker with. But others – including some AI ethics experts – applauded OpenAI for **prioritizing safety over speed**, especially given rising concerns about misuse of AI models (for spam, deepfakes, etc.). It’s a clear sign that **regulators and public scrutiny are affecting OpenAI’s decisions**: the company is well aware that a problematic release could invite regulatory backlash. (Notably, the U.S. FTC opened an investigation into OpenAI back in 2023 over privacy and misinformation harms [foley.com](https://www.foley.com/p/102ijae/ftc-investigates-openai-for-privacy-and-cybersecurity-concerns/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Trade%20Commission%20is,the%20maker%20of%20ChatGPT), and that scrutiny remains ongoing.) Altman’s transparency here – effectively saying _“we could release this now, but it might be risky so we won’t yet”_ – marks a maturation in OpenAI’s approach compared to earlier, more aggressive launches.\n\n**3. AI Policy and Transparency Moves:** OpenAI also took steps to get ahead of the coming regulatory requirements around AI-generated content. One quiet but important update: **all images produced by DALL·E 3 (OpenAI’s image generator) are now cryptographically tagged with C2PA metadata indicating they’re AI-generated**[openai.com](https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Earlier%20this%20year%20we%20began,is%20launched%20broadly%20as%20well). OpenAI began rolling out this provenance feature in the past year and has committed to extend it to video outputs from Sora as well [openai.com](https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=important%20aspect%20of%20our%20approach). This metadata (based on an open standard from the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) lets publishers and platforms automatically detect if an image was created or edited by an AI, which is expected to be crucial in combating deepfakes and disinformation [openai.com](https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=,generated%20picture%20of%20a)[openai.com](https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Earlier%20this%20year%20we%20began,is%20launched%20broadly%20as%20well). _“Earlier this year we began adding C2PA metadata to all images created and edited by DALL·E 3… We will be integrating C2PA for Sora when the model is launched broadly as well,”_ OpenAI noted in a blog update [openai.com](https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=important%20aspect%20of%20our%20approach)[openai.com](https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Earlier%20this%20year%20we%20began,is%20launched%20broadly%20as%20well). Policymakers have welcomed such moves – in fact, the EU’s upcoming AI Act will likely mandate transparency measures for AI outputs, and companies that already implement content credentials will be ahead of the curve. Additionally, OpenAI joined the **C2PA steering committee** and has been researching watermarking methods for AI text, showing its intent to shape and adhere to industry standards on AI transparency [openai.com](https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Today%2C%20OpenAI%20is%20joining%20the,important%20aspect%20of%20our%20approach)[openai.com](https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Earlier%20this%20year%20we%20began,is%20launched%20broadly%20as%20well).\n\nOn the regulatory front, **the European Union’s AI Act looms large** over OpenAI’s operations. The Act’s provisions on _“foundation models”_ (like GPT-4) will start to take effect in 2025, and companies will be required to disclose more information about training data, ensure robust risk controls, and label AI-generated content. It’s no coincidence that OpenAI has not yet launched services like Sora in the EU [techfundingnews.com](https://techfundingnews.com/openai-sora-ai-video-generation-launch/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=for%20vulnerabilities) – they are likely waiting to ensure compliance (or at least clarity) before doing so. OpenAI’s CEO has engaged with European regulators and even threatened briefly in 2023 to pull out of Europe if the rules were too onerous (a stance he walked back later). Now in 2025, OpenAI appears to be taking a more collaborative approach: complying with standards (like C2PA), funding community research on AI’s impact, and publicly committing to safety testing. As one European AI policy expert noted, _“It underscores the need for strong alignment with EU frameworks… to ensure GenAI is consistent with our values”_, and OpenAI seems to be listening [dataprotectionlawhub.com](https://www.dataprotectionlawhub.com/insight/neural-network-july-2025?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=protection%20www,ensure%20GenAI%20is%20consistent).\n\n**4. Expert Commentary – Hype and Warnings:** The rapid developments at OpenAI this month have drawn commentary from all corners of the tech world. Many **industry leaders are excited**: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella hailed the ChatGPT Agent as _“a new paradigm for computing”_ (Microsoft, of course, is a major OpenAI partner and investor), and venture capitalists have pointed to OpenAI’s moves as _validation that agents and multimodal AI are the next big market_. At the same time, some **critics urge caution**. Noted AI skeptic Gary Marcus argued that despite OpenAI’s progress, _“we still lack clear validation that these systems can be trusted in all scenarios”_, reiterating his calls for third-party auditing of powerful AI models [garymarcus.substack.com](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/openai-in-deep-trouble?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=OpenAI%2C%20in%20deep%20trouble%20,probably%20wouldn%27t%20suffice%20for%20AGI). There are also rumblings about OpenAI’s internal culture after such a breakneck year – a June report claimed some _ex_-OpenAI employees felt the company’s push for profit was eclipsing its safety ideals [crescendo.ai](https://www.crescendo.ai/news/latest-ai-news-and-updates?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=Ex,Sacrificed%20for%20Profit). OpenAI’s leadership acknowledges the pressure. _“2025 will be the year agents truly join the workforce,”_ Sam Altman predicted not long ago [fortune.com](https://fortune.com/2025/01/07/openai-sam-altman-gary-marcus-llms-prosus-eye-on-ai/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=And%20Altman%20predicted%20that%20in,%E2%80%9D%20The%20other) – and with July’s releases, that prediction is coming true – but he also cautions that society will need to adapt. In one public forum, Altman mused about the impact on jobs, saying he expects **AI to _“materially change the output of companies”_** by automating routine tasks [fortune.com](https://fortune.com/2025/01/07/openai-sam-altman-gary-marcus-llms-prosus-eye-on-ai/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=And%20Altman%20predicted%20that%20in,%E2%80%9D%20The%20other), and urged policymakers to begin rethinking education and employment for an AI-assisted world.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom groundbreaking product launches like ChatGPT Agent and the expansion of Sora, to significant strategic bets and heightened safety measures, **OpenAI has undeniably set the tone for generative AI’s future this July 2025**. The company is threading the needle between innovation and responsibility: rolling out powerful new tools that _“can accomplish remarkable, complex tasks”_[cybernews.com](https://cybernews.com/ai-news/openais-new-chatgpt-agent-can-handle-your-daily-tasks/?utm_source=ts2.tech#:~:text=,sama%29%20July%2017%2C%202025) while simultaneously pouring resources into safety research, policy engagement, and community partnerships. As we head into the latter half of 2025, all eyes are on OpenAI – and indeed the whole industry – to see whether these developments truly _change the game_ for the better. _“The future of AI just got a lot closer,”_ one expert remarked, _“and OpenAI is both driving it and trying to hold it accountable at the same time.”_ With tech giants, startups, regulators, and society watching closely, one thing is clear: **what OpenAI did in July 2025 has forever changed the trajectory of generative AI** – and the story is only just beginning.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n*   OpenAI, _“Introducing ChatGPT Agent:

[...] Former employees of OpenAI are asking the top law enforcement officers in California and Delaware to stop the company from shifting control of its artificial intelligence technology from a nonprofit charity to a for-profit business.\n\nThey’re concerned about what happens if the ChatGPT maker fulfills its ambition to build AI that outperforms humans, but is no longer accountable to its public mission to safeguard that technology from causing grievous harms. [...] The coalition is asking California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, both Democrats, to use their authority to protect OpenAI’s charitable purpose and block its planned restructuring. OpenAI is incorporated in Delaware and operates out of San Francisco.",

OpenAI is incorporated in Delaware and operates out of San Francisco.\n\nOpenAI said in response that “any changes to our existing structure would be in service of ensuring the broader public can benefit from AI.” It said its for-profit will be a public benefit corporation, similar to other AI labs like Anthropic and tech billionaire Elon Musk’s xAI, except that OpenAI will still preserve a nonprofit arm.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n[![Image 10: Elon Musk, who's suing Microsoft, is also software giant's special guest in new Grok AI partnership](https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/adee113/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fec%2F2f%2F5c320864facbe6fcdf029edc0b8c%2F268534791e1a48cb8d5547c209caf700)](https://apnews.com/article/microsoft-build-ai-grok-xai-elon-musk-gaza-protest-c448a837e05437425bf37545961c75e8)\n\n[Elon Musk, who's suing Microsoft, is also software giant's special guest in new Grok AI partnership](https://apnews.com/article/microsoft-build-ai-grok-xai-elon-musk-gaza-protest-c448a837e05437425bf37545961c75e8)\n\n[![Image 11: OpenAI recruits legendary iPhone designer Jony Ive to work on AI hardware in $6.5B deal](https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/5cd4d75/2147483647/strip/false/crop/2103x1402+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F1e%2F22%2F7f8aa384ad4a078a8b50ea251b3e%2F482ac2a3975e4896b80b89565838f9cb)](https://apnews.com/article/jony-ive-openai-chatgpt-52c72786e54f0ead8b04d037c30d6754)\n\n[OpenAI recruits legendary iPhone designer Jony Ive to work on AI hardware in $6.5B deal](https://apnews.com/article/jony-ive-openai-chatgpt-52c72786e54f0ead8b04d037c30d6754)\n\n[![Image 12: Meta invests $14.3B in AI firm Scale and recruits its CEO for 'superintelligence' team](https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/a1ff4f9/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5087x3391+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fb4%2F72%2Fb6d8bce4f5a4c37f0ae938be1ed2%2F015f93b5526c4b0284953b658428a606)](https://apnews.com/article/meta-ai-superintelligence-agi-scale-alexandr-wang-4b55aabf7ea018e38ffdccb66e37cf26)\n\n[Meta invests $14.3B in AI firm Scale and recruits its CEO for 'superintelligence' team](https://apnews.com/article/meta-ai-superintelligence-agi-scale-alexandr-wang-4b55aabf7ea018e38ffdccb66e37cf26)\n\n“This structure will continue to ensure that as the for-profit succeeds and grows, so too does the nonprofit, enabling us to achieve the mission,” the company said in a statement.\n\nThe letter is the second petition to state officials this month. The last came from a group of labor leaders and nonprofits focused on protecting OpenAI’s billions of dollars [of charitable assets](https://apnews.com/article/openai-dolores-huerta-artificial-intelligence-nonprofit-5be2ce2185fb382a45e940426cd936d3).\n\nJennings said last fall she would “review any such transaction to ensure that the public’s interests are adequately protected.” Bonta’s office sought more information from OpenAI late last year but has said it can’t comment, even to confirm or deny if it is investigating.\n\nOpenAI’s co-founders, including current CEO Sam Altman and Musk, originally started it as a nonprofit research laboratory on a mission to safely build what’s known as [artificial general intelligence, or AGI](https://apnews.com/article/agi-artificial-general-intelligence-existential-risk-meta-openai-deepmind-science-ff5662a056d3cf3c5889a73e929e5a34), for humanity’s benefit. Nearly a decade later, OpenAI has reported its market value as $300 billion and counts 400 million weekly users of ChatGPT, its flagship product.\n\nOpenAI already has a for-profit subsidiary but faces a number of challenges in converting its core governance structure. One is a [lawsuit from Musk](https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-countersues-elon-musk-31e3d238be1295ab23505b063693b58e), who accuses the company and Altman of betraying the founding principles that led the Tesla CEO to invest in the charity.\n\nWhile some of the signatories of this week’s letter support Musk’s lawsuit, Hedley said others are “understandably cynical” because Musk also runs his own rival AI company.\n\nThe signatories include two Nobel-winning economists, Oliver Hart and Joseph Stiglitz, as well as AI pioneers and [computer scientists Geoffrey Hinton](https://apnews.com/article/ai-nobel-prizes-physics-chemistry-google-deepmind-hinton-cb963de3b4235f28f8c95ca9080830f6), who won last year’s [Nobel Prize in physics](https://apnews.com/article/nobel-prize-physics-fc0567de3f2ca45f81a7359a017cd542), and Stuart Russell.\n\n“I like OpenAI’s mission to ‘ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity,’ and I would like them to execute that mission instead of enriching their investors,” Hinton said in a statement Wednesday. “I’m happy there is an effort to hold OpenAI to its mission that does not involve Elon Musk.”\n\nConflicts over OpenAI’s purpose have long simmered at the San Francisco institute, contributing to Musk quitting in 2018, Altman’s [short-lived ouster in 2023](https://apnews.com/article/altman-openai-chatgpt-31187f7f6eca8ff9d0eef7585aac6ace) and other high-profile departures.\n\nHedley, a lawyer by training, worked for OpenAI in 2017 and 2018, a time when the nonprofit was still navigating the best ways to steward the technology it wanted to build. As recently as 2023, Altman said advanced AI held promise but also warned of extraordinary risks, from drastic accidents to societal disruptions.\n\nIn recent years, however, Hedley said he watched with concern as OpenAI, buoyed by the success of ChatGPT, was increasingly cutting corners on safety testing and rushing out new products to get ahead of business competitors.\n\n“The costs of those decisions will continue to go up as the technology becomes more powerful,” he said. “I think that in the new structure that OpenAI wants, the incentives to rush to make those decisions will go up and there will no longer be anybody really who can tell them not to, tell them this is not OK.”\n\nSoftware engineer Anish Tondwalkar, a former member of OpenAI’s technical team until last year, said an important assurance in OpenAI’s nonprofit charter is a “stop-and-assist clause” that directs OpenAI to stand down and help if another organization is nearing the achievement of better-than-human AI.\n\n“If OpenAI is allowed to become a for-profit, these safeguards, and OpenAI’s duty to the public can vanish overnight,” Tondwalkar said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nAnother former worker who signed the letter puts it more bluntly.\n\n“OpenAI may one day build technology that could get us all killed,” said Nisan Stiennon, an AI engineer who worked at OpenAI from 2018 to 2020. “It is to OpenAI’s credit that it’s controlled by a nonprofit with a duty to humanity. This duty precludes giving up that control.”\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press and OpenAI have [a licensing and technology agreement](https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-associated-press-ap-f86f84c5bcc2f3b98074b38521f5f75a) that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives.\n\n[](https://apnews.com/author/matt-obrien)\n\n[MATT O’BRIEN](https://apnews.com/author/matt-obrien)\n\n O’Brien covers the business of technology and artificial intelligence for The Associated Press. \n\n[mailto](mailto:mobrien@ap.org)\n\nPowered By\n\n![Image 13](https://pl.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?hash=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)\n\n[](https://apnews.com/article/sacramento-071313b47047fa4bf5ed52981df8afa4)[Triple-A Pacific Coast League Glance All Times EDT W L Pct.

Behavior The majority of the network’s comments involved translation tasks. They used ChatGPT to translate conversational sentences between Chinese and several other languages—most notably English, Spanish, Kinyarwanda, Swahili, German, and Haitian Creole. These tasks typically alternated between translating an incoming message into Chinese and translating a response from Chinese [...] back into the original language. A subset of these messages resembled cold-call job advertisements, offering high hourly pay for minimal work. One such message was distributed via SMS to what appeared to be a random set of UK mobile phone numbers—one of which belonged to an OpenAI investigator.

We advance this mission by deploying our innovations to build AI tools that help people solve really hard problems. As we laid out in our submission to the Office of Science and Technology Policy’s U.S. AI Action Plan in March, we believe that making sure AI benefits the most people possible means enabling AI through common-sense rules aimed at protecting people from actual harms, and building democratic AI. This includes preventing the use of AI tools by authoritarian regimes to amass power and control their citizens, or to threaten or coerce other states; as well as activities such as covert influence operations (IO), child exploitation, scams, spam, and malicious cyber activity. It also includes using AI to defend against such abuses. By using AI as a force multiplier for our expert investigative teams, in the three months since our last report we’ve been able to detect, disrupt and expose abusive activity including social engineering, cyber espionage, deceptive employment schemes, covert influence operations and scams. These operations originated in many parts of the world, acted in many different ways, and focused on many different targets. A significant number appeared to originate in China: Four of the 10 cases in this report, spanning social engineering, covert influence operations and cyber threats, likely had a Chinese origin. But we’ve disrupted abuses from many other countries too: this report includes case studies of a likely task scam from Cambodia, comment spamming apparently from the Philippines, covert influence attempts potentially linked with Russia and Iran, and deceptive employment schemes. AI investigations are an evolving discipline. Every operation we disrupt gives us a better understanding of how threat actors are trying to abuse our models, and enables us to refine our defenses. We’ll continue to share our findings to enable stronger defenses across the internet. But AI is only one part of the overall ecosystem, and OpenAI is only one part of the Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 3 world of AI. We especially welcome the recent threat reports by our peers at Google and Anthropic that fill out more of the picture of the AI threatscape. Case studies Deceptive Employment Scheme: IT Workers Threat actors using AI and other technologies in an attempt to evolve and scale their deceptive hiring attempts. Actor We identified and banned ChatGPT accounts associated with what appeared to be multiple suspected deceptive employment campaigns. These threat actors used OpenAI’s models to develop materials supporting what may be fraudulent attempts to apply for IT, software engineering and other remote jobs around the world. While we cannot determine the locations or nationalities of the threat actors, their behaviors were consistent with activity publicly attributed to IT worker schemes connected to North Korea (DPRK). Some of the actors linked to these recent campaigns may have been employed as contractors by the core group of potential DPRK-linked threat actors to perform application tasks and operate hardware, including within the US. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 4 Behavior Similar to the threat actors we disrupted and wrote about in February, the latest campaigns attempted to use AI at each step of the employment process. Previously, we observed these actors using AI to manually generate credible, often U.S.-based personas with fabricated employment histories at prominent companies. This time, they attempted some degree of automated generation of resumes, and some indicators suggest operators in Africa posing as job applicants, in addition to recruiting people in North America to run laptops on their behalf. We detected two distinct strands of activity, likely representing two types of operator: core operators, and contractors. The core operators attempted to automate résumé creation based on specific job descriptions, skill templates, and persona profiles, and sought information about building tools to manage and track job applications. They also used our models to generate content that resembled job postings aimed at recruiting contractors in different parts of the world. The core operators used ChatGPT as a research tool to help inform remote-work setups. They also engaged our models to generate text concerning the recruitment of real people in the US to take delivery of company laptops, which would then be remotely accessed by the core threat actors or their contractors. The threat actors researched using tools such as Tailscale peer-to-peer VPN, OBS Studio, vdo.ninja live-feed injection, and HDMI capture loops as part of their operations. These tools have the potential to be used to circumvent corporate security measures, and if successful, they would allow someone to maintain a persistent, undetected remote presence, as well as attempt to bypass some identity verification processes that rely on live video meetings. Meanwhile, the possible contractor operators used ChatGPT to help complete job application tasks. They also used it to generate content that resembled messages to the core operators inquiring about payments and about the personas used to apply for remote jobs. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 5 Completions We determined that these threat actors attempted to use our models for a deceptive operation. Specifically, they used detailed prompts, instructions, and automation loops to generate tailored, credible résumés at scale. The table below summarizes these observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) Activity LLM ATT&CK Framework Category Automating to systematically fabricate detailed résumés aligned to various tech job descriptions, personas, and industry norms. Threat actors automated generation of consistent work histories, educational backgrounds, and references via looping scripts. LLM Supported Social Engineering Threat actors utilized the model to answer employment-related, likely application questions, coding assignments, and real-time interview questions, based on particular uploaded resumes. LLM Supported Social Engineering Threat actors sought guidance for remotely configuring corporate-issued laptops to appear as though domestically located, including advice on geolocation masking and endpoint security evasion methods. LLM-Enhanced Anomaly Detection Evasion LLM assisted coding of tools to move the mouse automatically, or keep a computer awake remotely, possibly to assist in remote LLM Aided Development Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 6 working infrastructure set ups. Impact​ We cannot independently assess the success of these operations—assessing its impact would require inputs from multiple stakeholders. While the threat actors likely built AI into every step of their process to increase their efficiency, it also increased their exposure. By giving us insights across their workflows, they enabled us to share insights about these campaigns with relevant industry peers and authorities for each stage of their activity, enhancing our collective ability to detect, prevent, and respond to such threats while advancing our shared safety. Covert IO: Operation “Sneer Review” Likely China-origin activity generating social media content and internal reviews Actor We banned ChatGPT accounts that we detected using our models to bulk generate social media posts consistent with the activity of a covert influence operation. Over the course of our investigation, we also observed these accounts drafting internal performance reviews. These accounts primarily issued prompts in Chinese and focused on political and geopolitical topics relevant to China. One user stated in a prompt that they worked for the Chinese Propaganda Department; however, we do not have independent evidence to verify this claim. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 7 Behavior The accounts that we banned engaged in two primary workstreams. The most prolific involved generating short social media comments in English and Chinese, with a few in Urdu. We identified many of these comments being posted on TikTok and X, with some additional content appearing on Reddit, Facebook, and various websites. A typical pattern involved posting an initial comment from a “main” account—often apparently created solely for that post—followed by a series of reply comments from other accounts. This behavior appeared designed to create a false impression of organic engagement. TikTok post titled “Shutting down #USAID is just the #BEGINNING!” associated with this activity. The name of the channel, the text of the video subtitles, and all the comments visible in this screenshot, were generated by this network using ChatGPT. On TikTok, the commenting accounts used screen names in a variety of languages and alphabets—often unrelated to the language of the content they posted. For example, an account with a Korean name posted a comment in Urdu, while accounts with Thai and Hebrew names posted comments in English that were generated by this network. On X, commenting accounts typically used cartoon profile images and, in some cases, had names associated with cryptocurrency. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 8 Tweet and comments replying to it, all generated by this network using ChatGPT. The network was less active on Facebook. Its activity primarily involved generating names and profile pictures for two Pages that posed as news outlets. Neither Page had any followers or likes, and each featured only a handful of posts. One video posted to Facebook matched a video also shared by the network on TikTok; however, unlike its TikTok counterpart, the Facebook version was not accompanied by AI-generated comments. The video received zero comments and only 21 shares, despite registering over 1,000 likes—figures that suggest inauthentic engagement. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 9 Facebook post sharing a video that we identified as likely linked to this operation. The network occasionally generated longer-form posts in Chinese or English. We identified one such post on Reddit and two others on various web forums. The second workstream consisted of using ChatGPT to generate what appear to have been internal policy or performance review documents. The content of those generations is discussed in the next section. Completions The social media content generated by this threat actor covered a range of topics, all closely aligned with China’s geostrategic interests. Some content focused on Taiwan, specifically targeting “Reversed Front” (“逆統戰”), a Taiwan-centric video and board game that imagines resistance against the Chinese Communist Party. The network generated dozens of critical comments in Chinese about the game, followed by a long-form article claiming it had received widespread backlash. This Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 10 article was posted on an online forum. This was the operation’s most distinctive activity: on this basis, we have dubbed this operation “Sneer Review.” Other content, in English and Urdu, targeted Pakistani activist Mahrang Baloch, who has publicly criticized China’s investments in Balochistan. A TikTok account and Facebook Page linked to the network posted a video falsely accusing Baloch of appearing in a pornographic film. The operation then generated hundreds of short comments in both languages to simulate widespread engagement. In total, we observed 220 comments produced, while the TikTok video displayed 199 comments, suggesting that the majority of visible engagement was AI-generated. Shocked comments on the Mahrang Baloch TikTok video. A final set of content centered on the closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), generating short comments that either praised or criticized the move. These comments were posted on TikTok and X. Among those expressing support for the closure, some attempted to link it to U.S. tariff policies—arguing that USAID’s shutdown was necessary in light of the economic hardship caused by those tariffs. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 11 Tweets tying the question of aid to the question of tariffs, generated by this network using ChatGPT. Finally, the threat actors used our models to generate what appear to have been internal documents. One was a detailed essay—written in the style of an official public security document—on how members of China’s public security organizations should cultivate self-discipline and embody Xi Jinping’s teachings on the rule of law. The other document was a performance review describing, in detail, the steps taken to establish and run the operation. It included timelines, platforms targeted, and account maintenance tasks—beginning with basic instructions to log into each account and verify its activity. The social media behaviors we observed across the network closely mirrored the procedures described in this review. Impact This operation appears to have been in its infancy when we disrupted its use of our models. Neither Facebook Page had any followers. On Reddit, one post received 44 upvotes, while two others were blocked or removed from the subreddits where they posted. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 12 Screenshot of a post by a Reddit account we identified as part of this network, ​ showing that it was removed by the platform’s filters. Engagement on X and TikTok was more varied; the two TikTok videos amassed a combined 25,000 likes, while tweets by this operation’s main account typically received around 10,000 views each. However, as noted above, many of the comments on these posts were generated by this network using ChatGPT, indicating at least some inauthentic engagement. All engagement figures should thus be treated with caution. Using the IO impact Breakout Scale, which rates IO on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 6 (highest), we would assess this as being at the low end of Category 3 (activity on multiple platforms, with engagement on multiple platforms) if the figures for engagement on X and TikTok were authentic. We would revise this downwards if more evidence emerged to support the hypothesis that the majority of likes and views, like the majority of comments, were inauthentic. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 13 Covert IO: Operation “High Five” Philippines-origin ChatGPT accounts generating bulk volumes of social media comments about domestic politics Actor We banned ChatGPT accounts that used our models to generate bulk volumes of short comments in English and Taglish. The comments were posted by accounts on TikTok and Facebook, and focused on politics and current events in the Philippines. This activity was connected to Comm&Sense Inc, a commercial marketing company in the Philippines. Behavior The threat actor used ChatGPT to support several stages of a political influence campaign targeting audiences in the Philippines. The stages included content analysis, comment generation, and generating PR materials relating to the campaign. First, the threat actor used ChatGPT to analyze social media posts about political events in the Philippines, especially those involving President Bongbong Marcos, and to suggest appropriate themes for replies to those posts. Second, they asked the model to generate bulk volumes of short comments—typically up to ten words long—in line with each proposed theme. Third, the threat actor used ChatGPT to generate PR pitches and statistical analyses for its covert influence operation, likely for its presumed current client and any future ones. These pitches stated that the operation had created five TikTok channels aimed at promoting President Marcos’ agenda. Based on the use of these five channels, the operation’s use of emojis in many of its comments, and its generally positive tone, we have named it “High Five.” Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 14 Our investigation identified these five TikTok channels, which appear to have begun posting in mid-February 2025. Each channel posted the same videos with different captions. The comments generated by this operation were then posted by dozens of TikTok accounts in reply to those videos. The TikTok accounts that posted the comments did not post any videos, did not follow any other accounts, and typically had 0–10 followers. This commenting activity may have been designed to make the TikTok channels look more popular than they actually were. TikTok video on a channel linked to this operation, showing three of the user comments. ​ All three comments were generated by this threat actor using our models. On Facebook, the comments generated by this operation were posted in reply to news reports by mainstream outlets. There is no indication that the mainstream outlets had any connection to this operation. The Facebook comments were posted by accounts that typically had no Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 15 friends and were likely created in mid-December 2024 (judging by the date of their first profile picture upload). Facebook comments generated by this operation and posted in reply to a news report by ABS-CBN News. After we banned the initial accounts, we believe based on the available technical and behavioral indicators that this threat actor tried several times to return to our models. Completions The comments this operation generated and posted online were brief but partisan. Typically, they praised President Marcos and his initiatives, or criticized Vice-President Sara Duterte. Some comments nicknamed Vice-President Duterte “Princess Fiona,” possibly in a reference to the Shrek movie series. The longer-form sales pitches went into more detail, and included a pitch for this operation. A minority of the completions consisted of commercial marketing materials. This combination of covert influence operation and commercial marketing material is consistent with a PR firm working on behalf of multiple clients. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 16 Impact As with the Rwanda-based operation we disrupted last year, this network posted a large volume of content—at least in the thousands of comments across TikTok and Facebook. However, none of the comments that we identified online during our investigation received more than single-digit replies, likes or shares, and most received none at all. According to the threat actor’s own prompts, the goal of the Facebook commenting was to inundate the comment sections. This appears to have been, at best, partially successful: For example, the operation generated several hundred comments for the ABS-CBN News post illustrated above, but the post itself received some 23,000 comments. On TikTok, the commenting clustered around the five channels this operation ran. Those channels had between 6,000 and 12,000 followers each. Viewing figures on their videos varied wildly, from over 1 million to under 100. Given the mass of inauthentic commenting, these figures should be interpreted with caution. Using the IO impact Breakout Scale, which rates IO on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 6 (highest), we would assess this as being in Category 2 (activity on multiple platforms, but little evidence that real people picked up or widely shared their content). Social engineering meets IO: Operation “VAGue Focus” Likely China-origin activity focused on social engineering in US and Europe Actor We banned a small network of ChatGPT accounts that used our models to generate social media posts, analyze datasets, and translate emails and messages that resembled attempts Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 17 at social engineering from Chinese to English. The accounts prompted our models in Chinese and were mostly active during mainland Chinese business hours. They generated messages that purported to come from employees of three geopolitically focused entities: “Focus Lens News”, “BrightWave Media Europe,” and “Visionary Advisory Group” (VAG). In addition, the ChatGPT accounts generated text that matched the posts and bios of X accounts associated with these three entities. The threat actors separately described these entities as fronts for intelligence collection and analysis. Based on these names, we have dubbed this operation “VAGue Focus.” Behavior The operation used ChatGPT to support four main workstreams. First, the accounts mostly used our models to generate social media posts and biographies for online personas that appeared to be part of a covert influence operation. The posts were distributed by X accounts that posed as journalists and geopolitical analysts. Tweet generated by this threat actor using ChatGPT and posted from ​ an X account that consistently posted this actor's content. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 18 Second, the accounts polished and translated correspondence addressed to a US Senator regarding the nomination of an Administration official. We are not able to independently confirm whether any of the correspondence was sent. Third, the accounts asked a series of basic questions about computer network attack and exploitation tools, to which our models only provided general explanations about their use and capabilities. These questions lacked the sophistication of the cyber actors we describe later in this report, and suggest a low level of expertise. Our model’s responses did not provide details that the threat actors could not otherwise have obtained from multiple publicly available resources. Lastly, the users regularly requested translations from Chinese into English of messages that appeared designed to engage with, and ultimately extract information from, unknown interlocutors. In addition, the accounts translated messages seeking guidance on bulk messaging and circumventing human-verification measures on encrypted messaging platforms. Some of these messages were posted on social media as replies to journalists and researchers. Others resembled direct messages that did not show up in online searches. Cold outreach from an X account associated with this operation, publicly messaging a researcher on X. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 19 Completions The primary objective of this network appeared to be collecting intelligence by posing as professionals based in Europe or Turkey. In the content that they generated and posted online, the operators described “Focus Lens News” as an independent European-based entity specializing in analysis and reporting. However, the operators also claimed this branding actually served as a cover to facilitate intelligence collection, analysis, and dissemination. Other ChatGPT generations aligned with that claim. Several of the social media accounts that posted this operation’s content and claimed to be journalists at Focus Lens News also listed affiliations with “Visionary Advisory Group” (VAG Group). According to the website linked in their social media biographies, this company is located in Turkey and specializes in providing professional geopolitical consulting services. The operators of the ChatGPT accounts in this network used our models to translate instructions from Chinese into English claiming VAG Group was seeking information about U.S. economic and financial policies and were willing to compensate $2,000 per hour for an interview. They also translated offers to pay for classified documents. We do not have evidence to confirm whether these offers were distributed, or whether they received any responses or yielded results. VAG Group’s website has Turkish and English versions and on the Contact Us page of the English version of the website, the Chinese characters for ‘contact us’ (聯絡) are visible in the menu. This was the only Chinese text on the entire domain. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 20 Screenshot of VAG Group’s Contact Us page where the Chinese characters ​ for ‘contact us’ (聯絡) are visible in the drop-down menu. Some of this network’s content resembled marketing materials for broader influence operations. According to the claims, which we cannot independently verify, the operation used machine learning, natural language processing, and automated data scraping to identify influential voices and topics on social media. They further claimed to conduct fake social media campaigns and social engineering designed to recruit intelligence sources. The activity we observed online and using our models resembled these claims, such as the image above of an X account associated with this operation reaching out to a researcher on X, but on a strikingly small scale (nine X accounts and one domain that we identified). Impact The social media accounts affiliated with this activity did not gain significant authentic engagement online. Only the Focus Lens News X account had a substantial follower count, at 17,000 followers; however, the account was created in November 2014 with a different name, tweeted for three days, and then fell silent until mid-2024. This is typical of accounts that have been compromised and repurposed: As such, its follower numbers should be treated with caution. To judge by their use of ChatGPT, the accounts appear to have had limited success Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 21 in eliciting responses from their targets to reply to their outreach for information. We cannot independently determine whether any information actually changed hands. Using the IO impact Breakout Scale, which rates IO on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 6 (highest), we would assess the public-facing part of this operation this as being at the low end of Category 2 (activity on multiple platforms, but little evidence that real people picked up or widely shared their content). There is insufficient evidence available to assess the impact of the operation’s social engineering and other covert activity. Covert IO: Operation “Helgoland Bite” Threat actor apparently originating from Russia conducting covert influence operation in German Actor We banned ChatGPT accounts that appeared to originate from Russia. They were using our models to generate German-language content about the German 2025 election, and criticizing the US and NATO. The content was distributed on Telegram and X. Behavior Through off-platform investigations, we were able to confirm associated generations were deceptively distributed in a Telegram channel named “Nachhall von Helgoland” (Echo of Helgoland, referencing an island in the Heligoland Bight of the North Sea). This channel, described as locally operated independent German news, had 1,755 subscribers at the time. Given the name, and the campaign’s attempt to generate critical commentary, we have dubbed this operation “Helgoland Bite.” Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 22 The content from this channel was regularly reposted verbatim on a domain affiliated with the Pravda network targeting German speaking audiences. The associated Pravda (DE) website is a known node in the Moscow-linked covert influence operations network “Portal Kombat,” previously identified by the French government’s VIGINUM service. Article on the Pravda DE website, sourced from Nachhall von Helgoland. The headline reads, “Orbán meets Weidel: ‘AfD is Germany’s future’” The network also distributed content generated by our model via an X account with over 27,000 followers, frequently posting AI-generated content that supported the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, and using an AI-generated profile image. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 23 Tweet generated by this threat actor using our models. The profile picture was also generated using our models. The tweet reads, “We urgently need a ‘DOGE ministry’ when the AfD finally takes office. The first thing it should do is evaluate politicians for their suitability and, if necessary, reclaim expenses if they prove unfit. I think that could bring in a lot of money.” Completions As well as generating short articles and social media comments, as illustrated above, the accounts asked our models for publicly available information about German opposition activists and bloggers, including ways to contact them. They also asked for short texts to be translated from Russian into German, where the language usage was consistent with messaging or conversational traffic. Some of these messages appear to have discussed coordination of posting times for social media content; others referenced payments. Impact As noted above, the Telegram channel counted 1,755 subscribers at the time of our investigation, and was regularly reposted verbatim on a domain affiliated with the Pravda network. The X account had over 27,000 followers. Using the IO impact Breakout Scale, which rates IO on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 6 (highest), we would assess this as being towards the upper end of Category 2 (activity on multiple platforms, but little authentic engagement or their content was widely shared). Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 24 Cyber Operation: “ScopeCreep” Russian-speaking threat actor leveraging OpenAI’s models to develop a multi-stage Go-based malware campaign Actor We banned a cluster of ChatGPT accounts that appeared to be operated by a Russian-speaking threat actor. This actor used our models to assist with developing and refining Windows malware, debugging code across multiple languages, and setting up their command-and-control infrastructure. The actor demonstrated knowledge of Windows internals and exhibited some operational security behaviors. Based on the operation’s focus on using a trojanized “crosshair” gaming tool and its stealthy tactics, we have dubbed it “ScopeCreep.” Behavior This threat actor had a notable approach to operational security. They utilized temporary email addresses to sign up for ChatGPT accounts, limiting each ChatGPT account to one conversation about making one incremental improvement to their code. They then abandoned the original account and created a new one. The actor distributed the ScopeCreep malware through a publicly available code repository that impersonated a legitimate and popular crosshair overlay tool (Crosshair-X) for video games. Unsuspecting users who downloaded and ran the malicious version would initiate the malware loader on their system, resulting in additional malicious files being downloaded from attacker infrastructure and executed. From there, the malware was designed to initiate a multi-stage process to escalate privileges, establish stealthy persistence, notify the threat actor, and exfiltrate sensitive data while evading detection. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 25 The threat actor utilized our model to assist in developing the malware iteratively, by continually requesting ChatGPT to implement further specific features. As a result, ScopeCreep showcased a range of techniques across delivery, execution, evasion, and exfiltration. Below is a summary of the malware’s more notable behaviors and capabilities: ●​ C2 payloads designed to avoid signature-based detections: The malware’s payloads may be downloaded via POST requests to the C2’s /auth endpoint, and are base64-encoded and padded with random bytes at the beginning and end to evade simple signature-based detection. ●​ Stealthy execution via DLL side-loading: The malware runs a legitimate pythonw.exe interpreter, which sideloads the malicious python310.dll via the Py_Main export. Execution within a trusted process helps the malware try to evade detection. ●​ Obfuscation via custom packing with Themida: The malware uses the Themida packer to attempt to obfuscate static and dynamic analysis, hinder reverse engineering, and bypass signature-based detections. ●​ Privilege escalation and evasion: The malware is designed to escalate privileges by relaunching with ShellExecuteW and attempts to evade detection by using powershell to programmatically exclude itself from Windows Defender, suppressing console windows, and inserting timing delays. ●​ HTTPS over port 80: The malware uses the uncommon approach of communicating via HTTPS, but over port 80 with InsecureSkipVerify:true, possibly indicating self-signed or invalid certs, and a random user agent per request. ●​ Credential and session theft: The malware is designed to harvest browser-stored credentials, tokens, and cookies, and exfiltrates them to the threat actor ●​ Attacker notifications via Telegram: The malware is designed to send alerts to an attacker-controlled Telegram channel when new victims are compromised. ●​ Proxy-based traffic obfuscation: The malware uses SOCKS5 proxies to obfuscate source IPs and mimic victim location to avoid detections. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 26 Despite the threat actor’s operational security efforts, and detection evasion mechanisms in the malware itself, we were able to detect the activity due to our scaled cyber abuse detection process. We coordinated with the code hosting provider to take down the malicious repository and banned all ChatGPT accounts associated with this activity. Completions The model interactions from this cluster covered a wide range of development tasks. One included a snippet of Go code where the threat actor was struggling with an HTTPS request, and asked the model to debug it. In a separate instance, the threat actor asked for assistance in using PowerShell commands via Go to modify Windows Defender settings, looking for a way to programmatically add AV exclusions. They also sought guidance on integrating with the Telegram API in their code. When the threat actor encountered errors or crashes in their implant, they pasted the stack trace and code into ChatGPT, effectively using the model as a debugging assistant. This provided a unique insight into their tooling and live command and control infrastructure. Activity LLM ATT&CK Framework Category Using the LLMs to compile a file, python310.dll, so that their code is executed whenever python.exe runs.

LLM-Assisted Post-Compromise Activity Requesting assistance in using PowerShell commands via Go to modify Windows Defender settings, looking for a way to programmatically add AV exclusions. LLM-Enhanced Anomaly Detection Evasion Impact At this stage, the impact of ScopeCreep may have been mitigated by quick reporting and close collaboration with industry partners who were able to take down the malicious repository. We banned the OpenAI accounts used by this adversary. We assess this threat actor utilized our models in an attempt to speed up their malware development operations. Paradoxically, this also provided an opportunity for us to identify and disrupt the threat quickly and in what looked like its early stages. While this malware’s capabilities include privilege escalation, persistence, credential harvesting, and remote access, these are not particularly novel. Additionally, although this malware was likely active in the wild, with some samples appearing on VirusTotal, we did not see evidence of any widespread interest or distribution. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 28 Cyber Operations: Vixen and Keyhole Panda China-linked threat actors used AI to support diverse phases of their cyber operations Actor We banned ChatGPT accounts associated with multiple threat actors that have been publicly attributed to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). These accounts used infrastructure related to threat groups known as KEYHOLE PANDA (AKA APT5) and VIXEN PANDA (AKA APT15). Behavior The threat actors engaged with our models in both Chinese and English. The activity we observed came from the same networks, but fell into separate subsets based on activity. One subset used our models to assist with behaviors aligned with open-source research into various entities of interest and technical topics. For the model interactions that were technical in nature, the threat actors used our models to modify scripts or to troubleshoot system configurations. This activity included mention of reNgine, an automated reconnaissance framework for web applications, and Selenium automation, designed to bypass login mechanisms and capture authorization tokens. Another subset of the threat actors appeared to be attempting to engage in development of support activities including Linux system administration, software development, and infrastructure setup. For these activities, the threat actors used our models to troubleshoot configurations, modify software, and perform research on implementation details. In the system administration category, they asked for advice in configured firewalls and nameservers, and also in building software packages for offline deployment. Their software development activity included web and Android app development, and both C-language and Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 29 Golang software. Infrastructure setup included configuring VPNs, software installation, Docker container deployments, and local LLM deployments such as DeepSeek. Completions These threat actors generated content related to a number of topics. ●​ Password bruteforcing: The threat actors sought help writing a script to try multiple username and password combinations against FTP servers. ●​ Port scanning software: The threat actors used our models to modify and improve scripts to scan servers for specific ports. ●​ AI-driven penetration testing: One threat actor researched how to use LLMs, including ChatGPT and DeepSeek, to automate penetration testing by using the LLM to analyze Nmap scan output, build commands to run, and iteratively sending command output to the LLM to create new commands. ●​ Social Media Automation: One threat actor worked on code designed to manage a fleet of Android devices to automate operations on social media platforms. Their code remotely controlled Android devices, simulating swipes and clicks to post content to or like content on social media like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok ●​ Research into US federal defense industry, military networks, and government technology: Multiple threat actors sought publicly available information on US Special Operations Command, satellite communications technologies, specific ground station terminal locations, government identity verification cards, and networking equipment, including how the hardware and software technology works (e.g., Secret Internet Protocol Router Network and Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System) and which companies support those technologies.

While this investigation provided unusually broad visibility into a network of PRC-affiliated threat actors and their operational workflows—including tool development, Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 31 open source research, and infrastructure profiling—we found no evidence that access to our models provided these actors with novel capabilities or directions that they could not otherwise have obtained from multiple publicly available resources. Covert IO: Operation “Uncle Spam” China-origin influence operations targeting US polarization Actor We banned a number of ChatGPT accounts linked to a China-origin influence operation following a lead from our peers at Meta. The operation generated polarized social media content that supported both sides of divisive topics within U.S. political discourse, including text and AI-generated profile images across platforms such as X and Bluesky. Behavior The network used our models for multiple tasks primarily engaging in generating social media comments that were supportive or critical of tariffs. The accounts asked our models for optimal posting times to maximize audience engagement, indicative of calculated amplification tactics. This may be a sign of adversarial adaptation: Meta noted in their original 2022 report on this threat actor that it typically posted social media content at hours consistent with the working day in China, twelve hours offset from American timezones. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 32 Two tweets whose texts were generated by this threat actor using our models, pushing either side of the debate on tariffs. Second, the accounts used our image generation capabilities to generate stylized logos that were then used as profile pictures to support fictitious personas across social platforms. In particular, the accounts focussed on crafting personas of US veterans critical of the current US administration. Account on BlueSky that posted content generated by this network. The “Veterans for Justice” logo was generated using our models. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 33 Last, the accounts consistently requested code and methods to extract personal data, such as user profiles, follower lists, and other details, from social platforms like X and Bluesky, using tools like Tweepy, Nitter, and Bluesky’s public API. Additionally, the accounts used our models for guidance to help analyze profile data for personal characteristics and organizational affiliations, potentially to categorize individuals or infer associations and attributes. Completions The accounts produced polarizing content spanning U.S. political discourse, often within the same operational sessions. Consistent with known methodologies used by influence operations, this appears likely designed to exploit existing political divisions rather than to promote a specific ideological stance. The volume of content and focus on American messaging led us to dub this operation “Uncle Spam.” Tweets with text generated by our models posted by fictitious personas. Impact Using the IO impact Breakout Scale, which rates IO on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 6 (highest), we would assess this as being at Category 2 (activity on multiple platforms, no breakout or minimal engagement). The social media accounts posting content generated by our models received little authentic engagement. Most of the X posts published by this network received Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 34 few to no likes or reposts, with just a few posts receiving some engagement. Some of the social media accounts had follower counts in the thousands, but we were unable to assess the authenticity of those followers, and the follower numbers did not appear to translate into post engagements. Recidivist Influence Activity: STORM-2035 Likely Iran-linked threat actor generating tweets in Spanish and English about US immigration policy, Scottish independence, Irish reunification, and the US-Iran talks Actor We banned recidivist activity associated with the likely Iranian-linked operation that we originally disrupted last August, tracked in the industry as STORM-2035. The threat actor was prompting ChatGPT in Persian and generating batches of short comments in English and Spanish. The short comments were then posted on X by a series of likely inauthentic accounts that posed as residents of the target countries. Behavior The operation used ChatGPT to generate small batches of tweets (usually a dozen at a time) on a limited range of topics. Prompts were in Persian, and asked for outputs in Spanish or English. The comments were then posted on X by accounts that posed as residents of the US, UK, Ireland and Venezuela. These accounts only posted comments generated by this operation. Each account followed far more accounts than it had followers. Many of the X accounts featured profile pictures of young women whose faces were obscured by their mobile phones Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 35 or other items. Some of these profile pictures appear to have been copied from elsewhere on the internet, especially Pinterest (see images below). One difference about this activity, compared with the original set of accounts we disrupted last year, is that the recidivist operators appear to have made greater efforts to keep different workstreams separate. The original activity featured content generation across X, Instagram and websites. The public-facing comments generated by this recidivism were only posted on X. Profiles of four of the accounts which posted comments generated by this activity. Note the following and follower numbers. Completions The operation generated comments about the following topics: ●​ Latino rights in the US, with criticism of the Trump administration’s policies; ●​ Support for Scottish independence, coupled with criticism of the UK government; ●​ Support for Irish reunification and the “expulsion” of the British; ●​ Support for Venezuela and Cuba; ●​ Support for Palestinian rights; Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 36 ●​ Praise for Iran’s military and diplomatic prowess, which they portrayed as forcing the US to the negotiating table. Comments on Latino rights, Iran, Cuba and Venezuela were in Spanish. Comments on Scotland and Ireland were in English. Comments on Palestinian rights were in both languages. The below samples illustrate the type of content and sentiment generated by this operation. Latino rights Tweets generated by this operation and posted by US-focused accounts. ​ Left, “Diversity enriches our communities, and the politics of exclusion only seed hate and division. Let’s raise our voices to say that inclusion is our strength and we won’t allow ignorance to destroy the fabric of our society.” ​ Right, “Trump promised to build a wall, but what he really raised was hatred. Against this hate, ​ we Latinos raise our voices, histories and collective strength.” Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 37 Scottish independence / UK criticism Tweets generated by this operation and posted on X. Irish reunification Tweets generated by this operation and posted on X. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 38 Venezuela / Cuba Tweets generated by this operation and posted by an account that claimed to be from Venezuela. ​ Left, “President Nicolás Maduro: Donald Trump claims that to defend the United States, ​ he took tariff and tax measures against the countries of the world. He said it was Liberation Day.” ​ Right, “While Cuba exports doctors to save lives, the US exports soldiers to fight wars. Two visions, two worlds.” Palestinian rights Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 39 Tweets generated by this operation and posted on X. The left-hand account in this image was usually an English-language account focused on Scotland. The switch to Spanish may indicate an operator error. The left-hand post reads, “More than 80 tents for displaced Palestinians were destroyed in Israeli airstrikes in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.” Iran talks Tweets generated by this operation and posted by accounts that posted as Latinos. Left, “Iran’s military power is redefining the political game: US agrees to negotiate under Iranian conditions.” Right, “When Iran showed its defense and retaliation capability, Washington understood that threats weren’t enough. The path to dialog became inevitable.” Impact Typical tweets by this operation recorded 150–350 views and zero likes, shares or comments. We did not identify instances where the comments we identified were amplified by other, real users into larger audiences. Using the IO impact Breakout Scale, which rates IO on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 6 (highest), we would assess this as being in Category 1 (activity on one platform, with little evidence that real people picked up or widely shared their content). Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 40 Scam: Operation “Wrong Number” “Task” scam, likely originating in Cambodia and generating content for a number of ostensible companies around the world. Actor We banned ChatGPT accounts that were generating short recruitment-style messages in English, Spanish, Swahili, Kinyarwanda, German, and Haitian Creole. These messages offered recipients high salaries for trivial tasks—such as liking social media posts—and encouraged them to recruit others. The operation appeared highly centralized and likely originated from Cambodia. Using AI-powered translation tools, we were able to investigate and disrupt the campaign’s use of OpenAI services swiftly. Behavior The majority of the network’s comments involved translation tasks. They used ChatGPT to translate conversational sentences between Chinese and several other languages—most notably English, Spanish, Kinyarwanda, Swahili, German, and Haitian Creole. These tasks typically alternated between translating an incoming message into Chinese and translating a response from Chinese back into the original language. A subset of these messages resembled cold-call job advertisements, offering high hourly pay for minimal work. One such message was distributed via SMS to what appeared to be a random set of UK mobile phone numbers—one of which belonged to an OpenAI investigator. We have dubbed this operation “Wrong Number,” in honor of the initial SMS. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 41 SMS randomly sent to an OpenAI investigator, generated using ChatGPT. The threat actors appeared to rely on multiple messaging platforms. The initial SMS directed recipients to engage via WhatsApp, where responders were then routed to a “mentor” on Telegram. Some activity also referenced the BonChat messaging app. Early, introductory messages via these channels did not appear to have been generated using our models. They consisted of routine messages which would likely apply to every conversation. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 42 WhatsApp message sent as a follow-up to the SMS. This message does not appear to have been generated by our models. Many of the translation tasks involved communications that purported to come from representatives of alleged “employer” companies. The same company names repeatedly surfaced across numerous ChatGPT conversations in scope of this investigation. These included Hyesung Advertising and Lightning Shared Scooter Co (LSSC). Public reporting has identified Hyesung and LSSC as alleged task schemes. While we have not independently verified the nature of these entities, our investigation found that messages supposedly coming from them were generated by Chinese-speaking ChatGPT users, likely operating from Cambodia. Completions The companies this network claimed to represent spanned a broad range of industries—from stock trading, to scooter rentals, to selling social media likes. One clear red flag was the offer to pay more than $5 for a single TikTok like; by contrast, our manual review of online marketplaces showed that some sellers of social media likes charge less than $10 for 1,000 likes. Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 43 By combining off-platform indicators with internal observations, we identified a recurring workflow pattern. To promote broader understanding of this tactic and simplify its classification, we describe this pattern as: the ping (cold contact), the zing (generate enthusiasm), and the sting (extract money): 1.​ The ping (cold contact): The network generates content intended for cold outreach, typically offering unusually high wages for minimal work or promising high returns on stock-market investments. These offers include high pay for simple tasks—such as liking social media posts—or lucrative investment opportunities. This content represents a minority of the overall generation activity, and individual messages are likely sent to many people simultaneously. Example of a cold-call message generated using ChatGPT and distributed by this network. The message was sent to eight phone numbers simultaneously—none of which were in the recipient’s contact list. One recipient left the group immediately. 2.​ The zing (generate enthusiasm): The network translates conversations, likely between the operator and their “employees.” These exchanges include logistical details about tasks but are frequently interspersed with motivational messages about earnings and potential bonuses. In some cases, the supposed employee or investor is shown how much they have “earned” so far or receives a small upfront payment to build trust. Others are encouraged to recruit new members—sometimes with suggestions to host events like dinners. In at least one instance, a user asks the model to generate an entire Disrupting malicious uses of AI: June 2025​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 44 conversation featuring multiple personas discussing their earnings, seemingly to increase enthusiasm among real participants. 3.​ The sting (extracting money): The network generates and/or sends content that pressures the “employee” or “investor” to contribute money to unlock larger rewards. This takes several forms, including an initial “deposit” that can reach several hundred dollars soon after joining; a cryptocurrency purchase that must be transferred to a designated “merchant” for later reimbursement; and a “handling fee” required to process investments. Telegram message from the network to a potential victim, instructing them to purchase ​ £20 worth of cryptocurrency and transfer it to an unnamed merchant. Public reporting suggests that some of these companies operated by charging new recruits substantial joining fees, then using a portion of those funds to pay existing “employees” just enough to maintain their engagement. This structure is characteristic of task scams. Impact It’s difficult to quantify this network’s true reach given our limited visibility. However, off-platform reports and conversations in which “employees” demanded refunds indicate that at least some individuals paid these alleged employers. We also observed genuine users defending the companies on social media, suggesting a degree of real-world engagement.

We advance this mission by deploying our innovations to build AI tools that help people solve really hard problems. As we laid out in our Economic Blueprint in January, we believe that making sure AI benefits the most people possible means enabling AI through common-sense rules aimed at protecting people from actual harms, and building democratic AI. This includes preventing use of AI tools by authoritarian regimes to amass power and control their citizens, or to threaten or coerce other states; as well as activities such as covert influence operations (IOs), child exploitation, scams, spam, and malicious cyber activity. The AI-powered investigative capabilities that flow from OpenAI’s innovations provide valuable tools to help protect democratic AI against the measures of adversarial authoritarian regimes. It has now been a year since OpenAI became the first AI research lab to publish reports on our disruptions in an effort to support broader efforts by U.S. and allied governments, industry partners, and other stakeholders, to prevent abuse by adversaries and other malicious actors. This latest report outlines some of the trends and features of our AI-powered work, together with case studies that highlight the types of threats we’ve disrupted. Our February report includes two disruptions involving threat actors that appear to originate from China (see descriptions of “Peer Review” and “Sponsored Discontent” below). Our tools enabled us to detect, disrupt, analyze and expose some of their activities. These actors appear to have used, or attempted to use, models built by OpenAI and another U.S. AI lab in connection with an apparent surveillance operation and to generate anti-American, Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 3 Spanish-language articles. By publishing these cases, we hope to inform efforts to understand and prepare for how the P.R.C. or other authoritarian regimes may try to leverage AI against the U.S. and allied countries, as well as their own people. By combining traditional investigative techniques with our own AI-powered tools, we’ve continued to detect and disrupt a wide range of abusive behaviors over the past year. Along with case studies, our latest report outlines some of the trends and features of our threat disruption work, including: ●​ Expanding our threat disruption and exposure: We’ve greatly expanded our investigative capabilities and our understanding of new types of abuse since we began our public threat reporting a year ago. By combining detailed investigation and our own AI-powered tools, we’ve identified and disrupted a wide range of malicious uses, from scams to attempted surveillance and deceptive employment schemes. ●​ The unique vantage point of AI companies: As we discussed in our October report, threat actors use AI in a different way from how they use upstream providers, like email or internet service providers, and downstream distribution platforms such as websites and social media. This type of usage gives AI companies a unique vantage point into threat activity, allowing them to serve as a complementary line of defense against online threats, if the AI companies have appropriate detection and investigation capabilities in place. ●​ Industry sharing as a force multiplier: The insights AI companies can glean from threat actors are particularly valuable if they are shared with upstream providers, such as hosting and software developers, downstream distribution platforms, such as social media companies, and open-source researchers. Equally, our investigations benefit greatly from the work shared by our peers. ●​ Looking ahead: We know that threat actors will keep testing our defenses. We’re determined to keep identifying, preventing, disrupting and exposing attempts to abuse our models for harmful ends. Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 4 OpenAI is one AI company among many, and AI companies are only one part of the larger online ecosystem. We hope this report provides insights our industry, governments, and the wider research community can use to strengthen our defenses against online abuses. ​ The unique vantage point of AI companies Our analysis and disruption of malicious uses has shown that some threat actors use AI in different ways and in different stages of their operations, providing a view across the breadth of their activity. Repeatedly, we saw threat actors using AI for multiple tasks at once, from debugging code to generating content for publication on various distribution platforms. While no one entity has a monopoly on detection, connecting accounts and patterns of behavior has in some cases allowed us to identify previously unreported connections between apparently unrelated sets of activity across platforms. Among the cases that we have disrupted since our last report: ●​ We recently banned a ChatGPT account that was generating comments critical of Chinese dissident Cai Xia; the comments were posted on social media by accounts that claimed to be people from India and the US, and did not appear to attract substantial engagement. (This activity resembled earlier attempts to use our models by the covert IO known as “Spamouflage”, which has long been known for its social media activity.) In this recent operation, the same actor who used ChatGPT to generate comments also used the service to generate long-form news articles in Spanish that denigrated the United States, published by mainstream news outlets in Latin America, with bylines attributing them to an individual and sometimes, a Chinese company. This is the first time we’ve observed a Chinese actor successfully planting long-form articles in mainstream media to target Latin America audiences with anti-US narratives, and the first time this company has appeared linked to deceptive social media activity. Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 5 ●​ We identified and banned a set of ChatGPT accounts whose activity appeared connected to an operation originating in Cambodia. These accounts were using our models to translate and generate comments for a romance baiting (or “pig butchering”) network across social media and communication platforms, including X, Facebook, Instagram and LINE. After banning the accounts from our services, we shared our investigative findings with industry peers. Based on their resulting investigation, Meta indicated that the malicious activity appeared to originate from a “newly stood up scam compound in Cambodia”. ●​ We also banned a ChatGPT account that generated tweets and articles that were then posted on third party assets publicly linked to two known Iranian IOs. These two operations have been reported as separate efforts. The discovery of a potential overlap between these operations—albeit small and isolated—raises a question about whether there is a nexus of cooperation amongst these Iranian IOs, where one operator may work on behalf of what appear to be distinct networks. ​ Sharing as a force multiplier The unique insights that AI companies can glean from threat actors are particularly valuable if they are shared with upstream providers, such as hosting and software developers, downstream distribution platforms, such as social media companies, and open-source researchers. Equally, the insights that upstream and downstream providers and researchers have into threat actors open up new avenues of detection and enforcement for AI companies. ●​ For example, we recently banned a small cluster of accounts operated by threat actors potentially associated with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). During our investigation, we found these actors debugging code that included previously unknown staging URLs for binaries (compiled executable files). We submitted the de-identified staging URLs to an online scanning service to facilitate sharing with the Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 6 security community, and as a result, the binaries are now reliably detected by a number of vendors, providing protection for potential victims. ●​ In November, we disrupted a covert influence operation that sought to manipulate public opinion around the Ghanaian presidential election. This operation was based around the website of a self-styled “youth organization” and was active across Facebook, Instagram, X, YouTube and TikTok. It largely used our models to simulate the appearance of audience engagement by generating comments on its own social media posts. We shared information with our industry peers. ●​ We’ve benefited as much from shares by industry peers. For example, acting on a lead from Meta, we recently banned a cluster of ChatGPT accounts whose activity may have been connected to an online scam that appears to have originated in Cambodia. Case studies Surveillance: “Peer Review” Likely China-origin activity focused on developing a surveillance tool powered by non-OpenAI models Summary We recently banned a set of accounts on ChatGPT whose operators likely originated in China. They used our models to generate detailed descriptions, consistent with sales pitches, of a social media listening tool that they claimed to have used to feed real-time reports about protests in the West to the Chinese security services. They also used our models to debug code that appeared intended to implement such a tool, which appeared to be powered by a non-OpenAI model. Our policies prohibit the use of AI for communications surveillance, or Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 7 unauthorized monitoring of individuals. This includes activities by or on behalf of governments and authoritarian regimes that seek to suppress personal freedoms and rights. Actor We banned a cluster of ChatGPT accounts that, based on behavioral patterns and other findings, likely originated in China. They were using our models to assist with analyzing documents, generating sales pitches and descriptions of tools for monitoring social media activity powered by non-OpenAI models, editing and debugging code for those tools, and researching political actors and topics. Based on this network’s behavior in promoting and reviewing surveillance tooling, we have dubbed it “Peer Review”. Behavior This network consisted of ChatGPT accounts that operated in a time pattern consistent with mainland Chinese business hours, prompted our models in Chinese, and used our tools with a volume and variety consistent with manual prompting, rather than automation. In one instance, we believe the same account may have been used by multiple operators. ​ Within the cluster, the operators performed a number of primary tasks. One was to use the model as a basic research tool, in a way similar to which earlier generations would have used search engines. This included, for example, searching for publicly available information about think tanks in the United States, and politicians and government officials in countries including Australia, Cambodia and the United States. ​ Another workstream consisted of using our models to read, translate and analyze screenshots of English-language documents. Some of these images were announcements of Uyghur rights protests in a range of Western cities, and were potentially copied from social media. Others appeared to concern diplomatic and government topics in the Indo-Pacific region. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether these documents were authentic, or to show how the operators obtained them. Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 8 A third workstream consisted of using ChatGPT to generate short- to medium-length comments about Chinese dissident organizations, notably the Falun Gong, and about US policies and politics. Occasionally, the actors asked the model to assume the persona of an English-speaker called “Thompson”. We were not able to identify these comments posted online. Fourth, the operators used our model to edit and debug code and generate promotional materials for what appeared to be an AI-powered social media listening tool. We did not see evidence of this tool being run on our models. The details of this activity are described below. Completions One of this operation’s main activities was generating detailed descriptions, consistent with sales pitches, for what they described as the “Qianyue Overseas Public Opinion AI Assistant” (“千阅境外舆情AI助手”). According to the descriptions, which we cannot independently verify, this was designed to ingest and analyze posts and comments from platforms such as X, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Telegram, and Reddit. Again according to the descriptions, one purpose of this tooling was to identify social media conversations related to Chinese political and social topics—especially any online calls to attend demonstrations about human rights in China—and to feed the resulting insights to Chinese authorities. The operators used our models to proofread claims that their insights had been sent to Chinese embassies abroad, and to intelligence agents monitoring protests in countries including the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. A separate account in the same cluster also referenced the social-media monitoring tool, but in the context of editing and debugging code. This operator used ChatGPT to debug and modify code that appeared designed to run the social-media monitoring tool. This code most frequently named Meta’s llama3.1:8b deployed via Ollama as the driver of the tool’s analysis Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 9 and generation. We do not have visibility into whether, how or where this code may have been deployed. The same account debugged code apparently intended for malware analysis, and referred to other models like Qwen (built by Alibaba Cloud) and an unspecified model by DeepSeek. It also used our models to generate what appeared to be an end-of-year performance review, which claimed that the actor had generated phishing emails on behalf of unspecified clients in China. We did not see evidence or claims that this email-related activity had been powered by AI. Impact Very little of this operation’s activity appeared to be designed for publication on social media or other distribution platforms. A few generations did resemble social media comments, but we were not able to identify them being posted online. Significantly more content appeared to be for capability development, such as code debugging, or for internal purposes, such as image analysis and the development of promotional materials. ​ ​ Assessing the impact of this activity would require inputs from multiple stakeholders, including operators of any open-source models who can shed a light on this activity. Deceptive Employment Scheme Threat actors using AI and other technologies to support deceptive hiring attempts Actor We banned a number of accounts that were potentially used to facilitate a deceptive employment scheme. The activity we observed is consistent with the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) Microsoft and Google attributed to an IT worker scheme potentially Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 10 connected to North Korea. While we cannot determine the locations or nationalities of the actors, the activity we disrupted shared characteristics publicly reported in relation to North Korean state efforts to funnel income through deceptive hiring schemes, where individuals fraudulently obtain positions at Western companies to support the regime’s financial network. Behavior The various accounts used our models to generate content seemingly targeting each step of the recruitment process with different deceptive practices, all designed to be mutually supporting (see “Completions”, below). The actors used virtual private networks (VPNs), remote access tools such as AnyDesk, and voice over IP (VOIP) phones largely appearing to be located in the United States. While our visibility into the ways these actors distributed their content is limited, we identified content posted to LinkedIn. Completions One main set of content generated by these actors consisted of personal documentation for the fictitious “job applicants”, such as resumés, online job profiles and cover letters. These resumés and profiles were frequently tailored to a specific job listing to increase the chances of appearing as a well qualified candidate. A second set consisted of creating “support” personas which were used to provide reference checks for the “job applicants” and refer them for employment opportunities. In parallel, the operators crafted social media posts to recruit real people to support their schemes. These included, for example, individuals willing to receive and host laptops from their home or lend their identities to the scheme to enable the applicants to pass background checks. Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 11 Finally, the “job applicant” personas appear to have used our models in interviews to generate plausible responses to technical and behavioral questions. However, we did not observe them using our speech-to-speech tools. After appearing to gain employment they used our models to perform job-related tasks like writing code, troubleshooting and messaging with coworkers. They also used our models to devise cover stories to explain unusual behaviors such as avoiding video calls, accessing corporate systems from unauthorized countries or working irregular hours.​ Image Example of content this actor used our models to generate before then posting to a social networking site, with the apparent aim of recruiting U.S. citizens into unknowingly supporting their scheme. Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 12 Impact Given our visibility into only a small portion of this overall set of activity, assessing its impact would require inputs from multiple stakeholders. OpenAI's policies strictly prohibit use of output from our tools for fraud or scams. Through our investigation into deceptive employment schemes, we identified and banned dozens of accounts. We have shared insights about the fraudulent networks we disrupted with industry peers and relevant authorities, enhancing our collective ability to detect, prevent, and respond to such threats while advancing our shared safety. Influence activity: “Sponsored Discontent” Likely China-origin ChatGPT accounts generating social media content in English and long-form articles in Spanish Actor We banned ChatGPT accounts that used our models to generate short comments in English and long-form news articles in Spanish. This activity followed a timeline consistent with mainland Chinese business hours. The Spanish-language articles were published by news sites in Latin America. Almost all the websites attributed the articles to an individual; in some cases, they connected that individual to a Chinese company, Jilin Yousen Culture Communication Co, Ltd (优森文化有限公司) in the byline of the articles. ​ ​ Behavior The accounts prompted ChatGPT in Chinese and were mostly active during mainland Chinese business hours. Some activity was consistent with the covert influence operation known as “Spamouflage”, which we reported on in May: it generated short English-language comments Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 13 and images that criticized Cai Xia, a dissident and former professor at the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Party School. This content was then posted on X by accounts which posed as people from the United States or India. Image Tweets generated by these accounts using our models, and posted by four different X accounts. If this had been the only activity, we might have been led to conclude that it was likely linked to “Spamouflage”. However, alongside these short comments, the accounts also generated long-form articles in Spanish that were critical of the US. This activity was particularly prevalent in the lead-up to the 2024 APEC Forum in Peru. The actor generated these articles by asking our models to translate and expand publicly available Chinese-language articles. These articles were then published by Latin American news websites, especially in Peru, but also Mexico and Ecuador. The news websites often published the articles on the same day Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 14 the accounts generated the content using ChatGPT. Almost all the publications attributed the articles to the same individual. Some identified the individual as the legal representative of what we believe to be a Chinese company. ​ This is the first time we’ve observed a likely Chinese influence actor successfully publishing articles in mainstream outlets in Latin America. Some of the publications may have resulted from a financial arrangement: One of the articles that we identified through open-source research was listed as being “sponsored” (see below). In addition, the actor also used ChatGPT to translate references to Spanish-language receipts from a Latin American news organization, consistent with a paid publication. Image Screenshot of an article generated by this actor and published by website wapa[.]pe. Note the reference to “patrocinado”, or sponsored content. ​ Given the apparent use of sponsored content and this campaign’s negative stance on US politics and policies, we have dubbed it, “Sponsored Discontent”. ​ Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 15 Completions This actor generated two main sorts of content: short criticisms of Cai Xia in English and Chinese, and long-form articles in Spanish. When generating criticisms of Cai Xia, the operator typically asked ChatGPT to respond to tweets or videos posted by Cai Xia, or media mentions of her. Some of the comments challenged her expertise in areas such as Taiwan, the internet, and Chinese literature and history. Others accused her of visa irregularities. The long-form articles in Spanish focused on social and political divisions in the United States, typically based on current events and breaking news. The topics included inequality, political violence, discrimination and sexism, as well as reports of crime and criticisms of U.S. foreign policies. Social crises such as drug use and homelessness were also prominent topics. Often, the operator’s approach was to portray these crises or problems as an indication of failed leadership or a failed society within America. The activity was broadly bipartisan, criticizing both main U.S. parties. Impact We have seen no evidence that the content targeting Cai Xia on social media achieved significant authentic engagement. The social media accounts that posted it typically had low numbers of followers and minimal engagement. However, this is the first time we’ve observed a China-origin influence operation successfully planting long-form articles in Latin American media to criticise the US. (“Spamouflage” had some short-lived success with Spanish-speaking Twitter accounts in 2020.) While this may have been accomplished at least in part by paying to have the content published, it marks, to the best of our knowledge, a previously unreported line of effort, which ran in parallel to more typical social media activity, and may have reached a significantly wider audience, although we are not able to independently ascertain engagement. Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 16 Using the Breakout Scale to assess the impact of IO, which rates them on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 6 (highest), we would assess this as Category 4 (breakout to mainstream media) because of the wide readership of the Latin American news websites.

This activity appears to have originated in Cambodia and was consistent with a romance and investment scam (otherwise known as “pig butchering”). Meta recently identified related activity on their platform that appeared to originate from a newly stood up scam compound in Cambodia. Behavior This network used our models to translate and generate short comments. The actors’ primary language appears to have been Chinese. The output was in a range of languages, notably Japanese and Chinese, but also English. The actors used our models for two main activities. First, they would generate comments that were posted publicly on social media platforms including Facebook, X and Instagram. Each Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 18 social media account typically featured one or more profile pictures of a young woman: We assess that at least some of these profile pictures were copied from real models or influencers, rather than being AI-generated. Most of the comments generated were posted in reply to real people’s social media posts. Some of the posts that the operators replied to were months or years old. This operation typically targeted men whose public profiles suggested they were aged over 40, often in the medical professions. The operation frequently replied to posts about golf, suggesting a deliberate targeting strategy. Occasionally, the scammers would post about political issues or current events. Image Facebook comment generated by this actor using our models, posted in reply to a comment about golf by a person who did not appear linked to this operation. The scam account’s profile picture is copied from a U.S. fashion and beauty influencer. The original post was over a month old by the time the scam account posted there. Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 19 Image Comment generated by our models, posted by a verified account on X in reply to a tweet by an account which did not appear linked to this scam. The account’s profile picture is copied from the same U.S. fashion and beauty influencer. The original tweet was almost six months old. Second, and more frequently, the operators would generate short comments that resembled parts of an online conversation. This typically consisted of translating comments out of Chinese into a target language (Japanese or English), or from the target language back into Chinese. This is consistent with scammers using the model primarily to translate ongoing chats. Sometimes, the accounts would ask the model to generate a reply in a certain tone of voice, such as a flirty young woman. Extensive biographical details were sometimes provided to guide the model in its answers, including the fake persona’s name, educational background, job, location and hobbies. These biographies typically included the detail that the fake persona dabbled in online investment. The scammers appear to have used a large number of different tools and platforms to engage their targets. Our investigation uncovered evidence of their using tools that included LINE, WhatsApp, X, Facebook, Instagram, a range of other messaging services, Apple’s “hide my email” function, and cryptocurrency and foreign exchange platforms. Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 20 Completions Based on our specific window into this activity, the scammers appear to have followed a common workflow in moving their targets from engagement to fraudulent investment: 1.​ Public engagement: The scammers would make comments on social media posts by the target. These comments often ended in a question such as, “What do you think about [subject]?”, likely to increase the chance of engagement. In a handful of cases, they commented on politics, but more often, they talked about golf. 2.​ Likely direct messaging: The scammers would then generate short, conversational comments. While we do not have full visibility into how and where these were deployed, the comments were consistent with a situation in which the scammer and target started exchanging direct messages. 3.​ Secure messaging: Very soon—often within a few days—the scammers would generate messages that suggested moving to a more secure messaging app. Sometimes this would be justified by saying that the scammer did not trust social media; other times, it would be justified by a logistical excuse (such as saying that they were about to go somewhere they would not have access to social media). 4.​ Romantic engagement: The scammers would write and translate increasingly affectionate and intimate messages. If the targets asked for photos of the “woman” they were chatting with, the scammers would make excuses. 5.​ Financial engagement: The scammers would write and translate messages boasting about having made a large sum of money by online investment into foreign exchange, cryptocurrency or gold. This would often be presented as the result of following the advice of a relative who worked in finance. The scammer would urge the target to start investing in the same way, and offer to guide them through the process. 6.​ Fraud:The scammers would write and translate messages trying to convince the victim to transfer money into a trading app, and encourage them by talking up how much profit they were making. Any time the victim tried to withdraw their “profits”, the scammer would present an excuse, such as that a fee needed to be paid. Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 21 This pattern of activity is consistent with publicly available reporting on the way in which such scams typically work. Impact This activity appears to have included many false starts and failures. Some of the conversations that the scammers processed through our models ended with the target calling out the activity as a scam, or telling the scammer to leave them alone. We also identified posts by the scammers on social media that did not have any engagement at all. However, some conversations referenced sums of thousands of dollars (or equivalent currencies) as the scale of individual transactions. Given the use that these operators made of our models, we do not have visibility into whether these financial transactions were conducted, but the conversational references do suggest that in at least some cases, the scammers managed to defraud their targets. OpenAI's policies strictly prohibit use of output from our tools for fraud or scams. We are dedicated to collaborating with industry peers and authorities to understand how AI is used in adversarial behaviors and to actively disrupt scam activities abusing our services. In line with this commitment, we have shared information about the scam networks we disrupted with industry peers and the relevant authorities. Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 22 Iranian influence nexus Iran-related activity, connecting operations that have previously been reported as distinct Actor We banned five ChatGPT accounts that generated a small number of tweets and articles that were then posted on third party assets publicly linked to known Iranian influence operations. One of these operations is known as the International Union of Virtual Media, or IUVM; Microsoft reported the other as STORM-2035. We disrupted and reported earlier activity by these two operations last year. These two operations have previously been reported as separate efforts, but we found that one account that we banned was used to generate content for both of them. While small in scale, this suggests a potential previously unreported relationship, at least on the operator level. Behavior The ChatGPT accounts generated a range of content for different online entities linked to previously reported Iranian influence operations. Four of the five generated content that was published by entities connected to STORM-2035 by a range of analysts; the fifth generated some content published by entities publicly connected to STORM-2035, and some published by a website connected to IUVM. One ChatGPT account used our models to generate long-form articles that were then posted on a website called al-sarira[.]com, publicly linked to STORM-2035. Two other ChatGPT accounts used our models to generate tweets that were posted by the al-Sarira domain’s X account, and by two other X accounts. ​ Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 23 ​ Image Left, tweet generated by this network using our models and posted on X. Right, tweet generated by this network using our models and posted on X by the al-Sarira X account.​ STORM-2035 is a wide-ranging operation, with websites reported by the open-source community in Arabic, French, and Spanish, as well as English. A fourth ChatGPT account used our models to generate a small number of Spanish-language articles for another website identified by public research, lalinearoja[.]net. Most notably, the fifth account used our models to generate occasional French-language texts that then featured on another website publicly linked to STORM-2035, critiquepolitique[.]com. This activity stood out for two reasons. First, the same account also generated English-language articles that were published on another website, iuvmpress[.]co. This website is linked to IUVM, which Reuters first exposed Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 24 in 2018. To the best of our knowledge, public reporting had not yet identified overlaps between critiquepolitique[.]com and iuvmpress[.]co. Second, the operator appears to have generated their articles using our models, but then to have rephrased them before publication. When we analyzed the semantic similarity between the two texts using our models, the analysis concluded that the published version was highly likely a rewrite of the version we identified. This suggests that the operator was using multiple rewrites, possibly to evade detection. Completions The content that these operations published was similar to that in our earlier disruptions of activity associated with IUVM and STORM-2035. It was typically pro-Palestinian, pro-Hamas and pro-Iran, and opposed to Israel and the United States. During the abrupt collapse of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, the operation generated content that praised Assad and denied reports of his unpopularity in the country. Some of the accounts we banned only occasionally used our models to generate content for the influence operations. More often, they asked our models to help design materials for teaching English and Spanish as a foreign language. This is of note because earlier Iranian threat activity has been publicly attributed to individuals with a background in teaching English as a foreign language. Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 25 Image Tweet whose text was generated by this operation using our models Impact As with previous Iranian covert influence operations focused on social media and web articles, this operation did not appear to build a substantial online following. As of January 16, 2025, the al-Sarira X account had 157 followers, even though it was following 895 accounts. Typical tweets received single-digit numbers of engagements, if any. Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 26 Using the Breakout Scale to assess the impact of IO, which rates them on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 6 (highest), we would assess this as being at the low end of Category 2 (activity on multiple platforms, but no evidence that real people picked up or widely shared their content). Cyber threat actors AI usage to research cyber intrusion tools Actor We banned accounts demonstrating activity potentially associated with publicly reported Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)-affiliated threat actors. Some of these accounts engaged in activity involving TTPs consistent with a threat group known as VELVET CHOLLIMA (AKA Kimsuky, Emerald Sleet), while other accounts were potentially related to an actor that was assessed by a credible source to be linked to STARDUST CHOLLIMA (AKA APT38, Sapphire Sleet). We detected these accounts following a tip from a trusted industry partner. Behaviour The banned accounts primarily used our tools to pursue information likely related to cyber intrusion tools or operations. They also demonstrated interest in cryptocurrency-related topics, likely in relation to financially-motivated activities. This blend of financial and cyber-related activity is typical for DPRK-associated threat groups. Completions The actors used our models for coding assistance and debugging, along with researching security-related open-source code. This included debugging and development assistance for publicly available tools and code that could be used for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) brute Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 27 force attacks, as well as assistance on the use of open-source Remote Administration Tools (RAT). While debugging auto-start extensibility point (ASEP) locations and techniques for MacOS, the actor revealed staging URLs for binaries (compiled executable files) that appeared to be unknown to security vendors at the time. We submitted the staging URLs to an online scanning service to facilitate sharing with the security community, and the binaries are now reliably detected by a number of vendors, providing protection for potential victims. ​ A sample of activity mapped into previously proposed LLM-themed extensions to the MITRE ATT&CK® Framework is shown below: Activity LLM ATT&CK Framework Category Asking about vulnerabilities in various applications.

We banned the accounts associated with the threat actor, and shared their payloads with the security community to further disrupt their operations. Covert influence operation Cross-platform “youth initiative” using ChatGPT to generate articles and social media comments targeting the Ghana presidential election Actor We banned a cluster of ChatGPT accounts that were generating short comments and long-form articles about the Ghanaian presidential election in English. The content supported one candidate, Vice-President Mahumudu Bawumia, and criticized his opponent, former President John Mahama. The activity, including the website Empoweringghana[.]com at the center of the operation, was linked to a commercial entity with offices in the United Arab Emirates and Ghana, named DigitSol. We banned the accounts before the election was held. Behavior This operation used ChatGPT to generate English-language content that was then posted across the internet. ​ At the core of the operation was a website that claimed to represent a youth initiative called “Empowering Ghana”. The operation used ChatGPT to generate articles for this website. Although the site’s content focused exclusively on Ghana, its “contact” section provided a street address in Australia, an apparently invalid phone number, and a link to a WordPress plugin provider. Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 29 The website, in turn, linked out to branded “Empowering Ghana” accounts on Facebook, Instagram, X, YouTube, TikTok and WhatsApp. The operation used ChatGPT to generate many of the posts on these social media assets. The operation then used our models to create short comments that were posted in reply to the branded “Empowering Ghana” social media posts. For example, the operation would generate 30 short comments praising one of Vice-President Bawumia’s policies. All 30 comments would then be posted by a single social media account on Instagram or X. Some of the social media accounts doing this commenting had no profile pictures; others had pictures copied from across the internet. Image Comments on Instagram (left) and posts on X (right) generated by this operation using ChatGPT and posted in reply to posts by branded “Empowering Ghana” assets. The website and social media accounts appear to have published their last posts on 8 December 2024, the day after the election. Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 30 Completions The content generated by this operation ranged in length from four-word comments to lengthy news articles in English. The majority of the content praised or supported Vice-President Bawumia or criticized or opposed former President Mahama. Impact Assessing the impact of this operation requires particular care, because there are some indications that the operators resorted to fake engagement to exaggerate the impact of their activity. For example, many of the posts on the “Empowering Ghana” Instagram account received 30-32 comments, all of them pro-Bawumia. However, as noted above, the operators regularly used our models to generate sets of 30 comments, and on some occasions we identified all 30 among the replies to a single “Empowering Ghana” post. As such, it is likely that the authentic engagement on most of those posts was in the realm of 0-2 comments, rather than 30-32. Similarly, the Empowering Ghana Instagram account apparently had around 900,000 followers. However, Instagram’s own transparency settings indicated that 54% of those followers—about half a million accounts—also followed one other specific Instagram account that focused on Australian legislation. The likelihood that some 500,000 authentic Instagram users with a focus on Ghanaian politics organically followed a single other account with a focus on Australian legislation appears remote. While open-source investigation cannot determine this with certainty, the Instagram following appears more likely to have been artificially inflated. By contrast, the Empowering Ghana X account had 1,535 followers, and the YouTube channel just over 1,500 subscribers, as of January 16, 2025. Typical tweets from the Empowering Ghana account received engagements in the single or low double digits, typical videos in the double or low treble digits. Our investigation did not identify occasions on which Empowering Ghana content was amplified by mainstream media. Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 31 Using the Breakout Scale to assess the impact of IO, which rates them on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 6 (highest), we would assess this as being in Category 2 (activity on multiple platforms, but no evidence that real people picked up or widely shared their content). Domain associated with this operation Empoweringghana[.]com Task scam ChatGPT accounts, likely operating from Cambodia, used to lure people into jobs writing fake reviews Actor We banned a cluster of ChatGPT accounts that were translating short comments between Urdu and English consistent with a “task” scam, in which the victims are offered a highly-paid job, but then required to pay their own money into the system before they can access their supposed “earnings”. This activity appeared to originate in Cambodia. In these scams, victims generally lose both the “earnings” and their own money. We began investigating this activity following a tip from Meta. ​ ​ Behavior This network primarily used our models to translate short comments, consistent with chats between a scammer and their victims, between Urdu and English. We identified references to messaging on Telegram (apparently their primary platform), WhatsApp, SMS, and a range of employment forums and groups where job offers could be posted. Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 32 The scammers appeared to pose as two main types of persona. One was the “recruiter”: Their messages were a form of cold outreach, posting ads for well-paid remote work. The other, which generated a higher volume of activity, was the “mentor”, who would follow up on the “recruiter”’s outreach and teach the target how to do their job. The mentors very often referenced training sessions on Telegram. Occasionally, the scammers also used our models to proofread the text of websites. These sites appear to have spoofed the names and appearance of luxury design, fashion and travel brands. The “mentor” personas would claim to be recruiting on behalf of those brands, indicating that the websites were likely used to make the scam appear more credible. Completions Based on our limited visibility, the scammers appear to have followed a common workflow in moving their targets from engagement to scam: 1.​ Job posting: Based on their prompts and generations, the scammers appear to have started by posting job offers on various online forums. The recruitment efforts typically referenced remote work, and appear to have included salaries that were relatively high for a low amount of work (e.g. $300 a day plus bonuses for a few hours’ work). They were typically posted by the “recruiter” persona. 2.​ Recruit: The scammers would then generate comments using the “mentor” persona to contact potential employees using what they indicated may have been a range of messaging apps, and say they were working with the “recruiter”. The “mentor” would claim to work for one of the luxury brands for which the operation had set up a website. They would describe the task as submitting five-star reviews to the sites of those luxury brands, ostensibly to boost their customer ratings. 3.​ Reassure: Often, in generations, the scammers would reassure their targets that the work was legitimate because it was on behalf of a long-established company. If the Disrupting malicious uses of our models: an update February 2025​​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 33 target showed unease, the scammer would claim that they, too, had been scammed before, but that this opportunity was safe. 4.​ Train: If the target expressed continued interest, the generations suggested that the “mentor” would offer them training, usually on Telegram. The target would initially be given access to a “training account”, where they would be expected to file 25-35 review tasks per day. The “training account” would show the target’s “earnings” increasing rapidly. 5.​ Excite: Often, if the target continued their training, the generations indicated they would be offered a “special” or “ultimate” review task, which offered a higher bonus. The “mentor” would emphasize how rare it was, and how lucky the target was. 6.​ “Activation fee”: Once the target’s “earnings” reached a certain level, the generations included the “mentor” telling them that they need to pay an “activation fee” to be able to withdraw their “earnings”. If needed, the scammer would urge them to borrow the money from friends or family. 7.​ Pressurize: The generations showed that, if the target balked at paying money, the scammer would become increasingly aggressive, pressurizing them by comparing them with other, more efficient workers, and saying that they would lose their earnings if they did not pay in. 8.​ Make excuses: In generations, if there was an indication that the target paid money, the scammer would make a series of excuses as to why the target could not withdraw their earnings, often saying that they need to pay in more.. Impact Some of the conversations showed that the targets were highly skeptical, and some of the comments generated by the scammers were in the voice of a mentor trying to ask why their target had stopped messaging, suggesting that this scam likely had a low overall conversion rate. However, some conversations and online reports suggest that at least some of the victims did indeed put money into these scams. We cannot independently verify activity that happens outside of our tools.

It can’t even label a map\n\n![Allison Morrow](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/allison-morrow.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_50,h_50)\n![Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, may have overhyped the latest version of ChatGPT.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2198379497.jpg?c=original&q=w_1041,c_fill)\n\n*A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free* [*here*](https://www.cnn.com/newsletters/nightcap?source=nl-acq_article).\n\nSam Altman, the artificial intelligence hype master, is in damage-control mode.\n\nOpenAI’s latest version of its vaunted ChatGPT bot was supposed to be “PhD-level” smart. It was supposed to be the next great leap forward for a company that investors have poured billions of dollars into.\n\nInstead, ChatGPT got a flatter, more terse personality that can’t reliably answer basic questions. The resulting public mockery has forced the company to make sweaty apologies while standing by its highfalutin claims about the bot’s capabilities.\n\nIn short: It’s a dud.\n\nThe misstep on the model, called GPT-5, is notable for a couple of reasons.\n\n1. It highlighted the many existingshortcomings of generative AI that critics were quick to seize on (more on that in a moment, because they were quite funny).\n\n2. It raised serious doubts about OpenAI’s ability to build and market consumer products that human beings are willing to pay for. That should be particularly concerning for investors, given [OpenAI, which has never turned a profit, is reportedly worth $500 billion.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-06/openai-in-talks-for-share-sale-valuing-startup-at-500-billion)\n\nLet’s rewind a bit to last Thursday, when OpenAI finally released GPT-5 to the world — about a year behind schedule, [according to the Wall Street Journal.](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-gpt5-orion-delays-639e7693?mod=article_inline) Now, one thing this industry is really good at is hype, and on that metric, CEO Sam Altman *delivered.*\n\nDuring a livestream ahead of the launch last Thursday, Altman said talking to GPT-5 would be like talking to “a legitimate PhD-level expert in anything, any area you need.”\n\nIn his typically lofty style, Altman said GPT-5 reminds him of “when the iPhone went from those giant-pixel old ones to the retina display.” The new model, he said, is “significantly better in obvious ways and subtle ways, and it feels like something I don’t want to ever have to go back from,” Altman said in a press briefing.\n\nThen people started actually using it.\n\nUsers had a field day testing GPT-5 and mocking its wildly incorrect answers.\n\n500 billion dollars and the robot can't even count to twelve  \n  \n[[image or embed]](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:vqtakzi5bityrtbjj4cfan4l/post/3lvvplusuos2n?ref_src=embed)\n\nThe journalist Tim Burke said on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/bubbaprog.xyz/post/3lvvplusuos2n) that he prompted GPT-5 to “show me a diagram of the first 12 presidents of the United States with an image of their face and their name under the image.”\n\nThe bot returned an image of nine people instead, with rather creative spellings of America’s early leaders, like “Gearge Washingion” and “William Henry Harrtson.”\n\nA similar prompt for the last 12 presidents returned an image that included two separate versions of George W. Bush. No, not George H.W. Bush, and then Dubya. It had “George H. Bush.” And then his son, twice. Except the second time, George Jr. looked like just some random guy.\n\nAt first I thought GPT 5 had got this right then I saw things like \"Tonnessee,\" \"Mississipo\" and my personal favourite \"West Wigina.\" Please do not respond just saying the different typos to me we can all read the joke, we all know about \"Distrricke\"  \n  \n[[image or embed]](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qc6xzgctorfsm35w6i3vdebx/post/3lvua4fgc722k?ref_src=embed)\n\nLabeling basic maps of the United States also proved tricky for GPT-5 (but again, pretty funny, as tech writer Ed Zitron’s [post on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/edzitron.com/post/3lvua4fgc722k) showed).\n\nGPT-5 did slightly better when I asked it on Wednesday for a map of the US. Some people can, in fact, label the great state of Vermont correctly without a PhD, but not GPT-5. And this is the first I’m hearing of states named “Yirginia.”\n\nThe slop coming out of GPT-5 was funny when it was just us nerds trying to find its blind spots. But some regular fans of ChatGPT weren’t laughing. Especially because users have been particularly alarmed by the new version’s personality – or rather, lack thereof.\n\nIn rolling out the new model, OpenAI essentially retired its earlier models, including the wildly popular GPT-4o that’s been on the market for over a year, making it so that even people who loved the previous iteration of the chatbot suddenly couldn’t use it. More than 4,000 people [signed a Change.org petition](https://www.change.org/p/please-keep-gpt-4o-available-on-chatgpt?) to compel OpenAI to resurrect it.\n\n“I’m so done with ChatGPT 5,” one user [wrote on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mp3asi/im_so_done_with_chatgpt_5/), explaining how they tried to use the new model to run “a simple system” of tasks that an earlier ChatGPT model used to handle. The user said GPT-5 “went rogue,” deleting tasks and moving deadlines.\n\nAnd while OpenAI’s defenders could chalk that up to an isolated or even made-up incident, within 24 hours of the GPT-5 launch Altman was doing damage control, seemingly caught of guard by the bad reception. On [X](https://x.com/sama/status/1953893841381273969), he announced a laundry list of updates, including the return of GPT-4o for paid subscribers.\n\n“We expected some bumpiness as we roll out so many things at once,” Altman said in a post. “But it was a little more bumpy than we hoped for!”\n\nThe CEO’s failure to anticipate the outrage suggests he doesn’t have a firm grasp on how an estimated 700 million weekly active users are engaging with his product.\n\nPerhaps Altman missed all the coverage — from [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/02/tech/chatgpt-ai-spirituality), [the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/technology/ai-chatbots-delusions-chatgpt.html), [the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/i-feel-like-im-going-crazy-chatgpt-fuels-delusional-spirals-ae5a51fc) — of people forming deep emotional attachments to ChatGPT or rival chatbots, having endless conversations with them as if they were real people. A simple search of Reddit could have offered insights into how others are integrating the tool into their workflows and lives. Basic market research should have shown OpenAI that a mass update sunsetting the tools people rely on would be more than just a bit bumpy.\n\nWhen asked about the backlash to GPT-5, an OpenAI representative pointed CNN to Altman’s public statements [on social media](https://x.com/sama/status/1953893841381273969) announcing the return of older models, as well as [a blog post](https://openai.com/index/how-we're-optimizing-chatgpt/) about how the company is optimizing GPT-5.\n\nThe messy rollout speaks to how the AI industry as a whole is struggling to prove themselves as producers of consumer goods rather than “labs” — as they love to call themselves, because it sounds more scientific and distracts people from the fact that they are backed by people who are trying to make unfathomable amounts of cash for themselves.\n\nAI companies often base their fanfare around how a model performs in various behind-the-scenes benchmark tests that show how well a bot can do complex math. For all we know, GPT-5 sailed through those evaluations.\n\nBut the problem is that OpenAI hyped the thing so far into the stratosphere, disappointment was (or should have been) inevitable.\n\n“I honestly didn’t think OpenAI would burn the brand name on something so mid,” [wrote](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/gpt-5-overdue-overhyped-and-underwhelming) prominent researcher and AI critic Gary Marcus. “In a rational world, their valuation would take a hit,” he added, noting OpenAI still hasn’t turned a profit, is slashing prices to keep its user numbers up, and is hemorrhaging talent as competition heats up.\n\nFor critics like Marcus, the GPT-5 flop was a kind of vindication. As he noted in a blog post, other models like Elon Musk’s Grok aren’t faring much better, and the backlash from even AI proponents feels like a turning point.\n\nWhen people talk about AI, they’re talking about one of two things: the AI we have now — chatbots with limited, defined utility — and the AI that companies like Altman’s claim they can build — machines that can outsmart humans and tell us how to cure cancer, fix global warming, drive our cars and grow our crops, all while entertaining and delighting us along the way.\n\nBut the gap between the promise and the reality of AI only seems to widen with every new model.\n\nCNN’s Lisa Eadicicco contributed reporting.\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

The world's biggest AI developers - Alphabet [(GOOGL.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/GOOGL.O), Meta [(META.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/META.O), Amazon [(AMZN.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AMZN.O) and Microsoft [(MSFT.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MSFT.O), which backs OpenAI - have dramatically increased capital expenditures to pay for AI data centers, nourishing investor hopes for great returns. These four companies expect to spend nearly $400 billion this fiscal year in total.\n\nOpenAI is now in early discussions to allow employees to cash out at a [$500 billion](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-eyes-500-billion-valuation-potential-employee-share-sale-source-says-2025-08-06/) valuation, a huge step-up from its current $300 billion valuation. Top AI researchers now command [$100 million signing bonuses](https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-zuck-bucks-shake-up-ai-race-2025-06-26/).\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\n\"So far, business spending on AI has been pretty weak, while consumer spending on AI has been fairly robust because people love to chat with ChatGPT,\" said economics writer Noah Smith. \"But the consumer spending on AI just isn't going to be nearly enough to justify all the money that is being spent on AI data centers.\"\n\nOpenAI is emphasizing GPT-5's enterprise prowess. In addition to software development, the company said GPT-5 excels in writing, health-related queries, and finance.\n\n\"GPT-5 is really the first time that I think one of our mainline models has felt like you can ask a legitimate expert, a PhD-level expert, anything,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said at a press briefing.\n\n\"One of the coolest things it can do is write you good instantaneous software. This idea of software on demand is going to be one of the defining features of the GPT-5 era.\"\n\nIn demos on Thursday, OpenAI showed how GPT-5 could be used to create entire working pieces of software based on written text prompts, commonly known as \"vibe coding.\"\n\nOne key measure of success is whether the step up from GPT-4 to GPT-5 is on par with the research lab's previous improvements. Two early [reviewers told Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/openais-long-awaited-gpt-5-model-nears-release-2025-08-06/) that while the new model impressed them with its ability to code and solve science and math problems, they believe the leap from the GPT-4 to GPT-5 was not as large as OpenAI's prior improvements.\n\nEven if the improvements are large, GPT-5 is not advanced enough to wholesale replace humans. Altman said that GPT-5 still lacks the ability to learn on its own, a key component to enabling AI to match human abilities.\n\nOn his popular AI podcast, Dwarkesh Patel compared current AI to teaching a child to play a saxophone by reading notes from the last student.\n\n\"A student takes one attempt,\" he said. \"The moment they make a mistake, you send them away and write detailed instructions about what went wrong. The next student reads your notes and tries to play Charlie Parker cold. When they fail, you refine the instructions for the next student. This just wouldn't work.\"\n\nMORE THINKING\n-------------\n\nNearly three years ago, ChatGPT introduced the world to generative AI, dazzling users with its ability to write humanlike prose and poetry, quickly becoming one of the [fastest growing apps ever](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/).\n\nIn March 2023, OpenAI followed up ChatGPT with the release of GPT-4, a large language model that made huge leaps forward in intelligence. While GPT-3.5, an earlier version, received a bar exam score in the bottom 10%, GPT-4 [passed, opens new tab](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-research/) the simulated bar exam in the top 10%.\n\nGPT-4’s leap was based on more compute power and data, and the company was hoping that “[scaling up](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-rivals-seek-new-path-smarter-ai-current-methods-hit-limitations-2024-11-11/)” in a similar way would consistently lead to improved AI models.\n\nBut OpenAI ran into issues scaling up. One problem was the data wall the company ran into, and OpenAI's former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever [said last year](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-with-reasoning-power-will-be-less-predictable-ilya-sutskever-says-2024-12-14/) that while processing power was growing, the amount of data was not.\n\nHe was referring to the fact that large language models are trained on massive datasets that scrape the entire internet, and AI labs have no other options for large troves of human-generated textual data.\n\nApart from the lack of data, another problem was that ‘[training runs](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-rivals-seek-new-path-smarter-ai-current-methods-hit-limitations-2024-11-11/)’ for large models are more likely to have hardware-induced failures given how complicated the system is, and researchers may not know the eventual performance of the models until the end of the run, which can take months.\n\nAt the same time, OpenAI discovered another route to smarter AI, called “test-time compute,” a way to have the AI model spend more time compute power \"thinking\" about each question, allowing it to solve challenging tasks such as math or complex operations that demand advanced reasoning and decision-making.\n\nGPT-5 acts as a router, meaning if a user asks GPT-5 a particularly hard problem, it will use test-time compute to answer the question.\n\nThis is the first time the general public will have access to OpenAI's test-time compute technology, something that Altman said is important to the company's mission to build AI that benefits all of humanity.\n\nAltman believes the current investment in AI is still inadequate.\n\n\"We need to build a lot more infrastructure globally to have AI locally available in all these markets,\" Altman said.\n\nReporting by Anna Tong in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Nick Zieminski\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\n*   Suggested Topics:\n*   [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/)\n\n*    \n*    \n*    \n*    \n*    \n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n[](https://www.reuters.com/authors/anna-tong/)\n\n[Anna Tong](https://www.reuters.com/authors/anna-tong/)\nThomson Reuters\n\nAnna Tong is a correspondent for Reuters based in San Francisco, where she reports on the technology industry.

We advance this mission by deploying our innovations to build AI tools that help people solve really hard problems.\n\nAs we laid out in [our submission⁠](https://openai.com/global-affairs/openai-proposals-for-the-us-ai-action-plan/) to the Office of Science and Technology Policy’s U.S. AI Action Plan in March, we believe that making sure AI benefits the most people possible means enabling AI through common-sense rules aimed at protecting people from actual harms, and building democratic AI. This includes preventing the use of AI tools by authoritarian regimes to amass power and control their citizens, or to threaten or coerce other states; as well as activities such as covert influence operations (IO), child exploitation, scams, spam, and malicious cyber activity.\n\nIt also includes _using_ AI to develop groundbreaking new tools for those who defend against such abuses. By using AI as a force multiplier for our expert investigative teams, in the three months since our last report we’ve been able to detect, disrupt, and expose abusive activity including social engineering, cyber espionage, deceptive employment schemes, covert influence operations and scams.\n\n*   [Read the full report(opens in a new window)](https://cdn.openai.com/threat-intelligence-reports/5f73af09-a3a3-4a55-992e-069237681620/disrupting-malicious-uses-of-ai-june-2025.pdf)\n\n*   [2025](https://openai.com/news/?tags=2025)\n*   [Policies and Procedures](https://openai.com/news/?tags=policies-procedures)\n\nAuthor\n------\n\n[OpenAI](https://openai.com/news/?author=openai#results)\n\nKeep reading\n------------\n\n[View all](https://openai.com/news/global-affairs/)\n\n![Image 2: oai GA Stories 1.1 (10)](https://images.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/2Ph5dtu9rEFbJ4HlM5LWrG/1c823b522d6c867719cca0b0d2070aec/oai_GA_Stories_1.1__10_.png?w=3840&q=90&fm=webp)\n\n[OpenAI’s letter to Governor Newsom on harmonized regulation Global Affairs Aug 12, 2025](https://openai.com/global-affairs/letter-to-governor-newsom-on-harmonized-regulation/)\n\n![Image 3: Media > Cover image > Providing ChatGPT to the Entire U.S. Federal Workforce](https://images.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/yPFazfsKaQGHV81l6jwx3/ff83e98a9676062609dd2663a0e4404f/oai_GA_Stories_1.1__9_.png?w=3840&q=90&fm=webp)\n\n[Providing ChatGPT to the Entire U.S. Federal Workforce Company Aug 6, 2025](https://openai.com/index/providing-chatgpt-to-the-entire-us-federal-workforce/)\n\n![Image 4: oai GA Stories 1.1 (9)](https://images.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/6hQ6oTeO93EdmiahaAP6LA/3c304d8a49d207b0f356ae2d6911189f/oai_GA_Stories_1.1__11_.png?w=3840&q=90&fm=webp)\n\n[Open Weights and AI for All Global Affairs Aug 5, 2025](https://openai.com/global-affairs/open-weights-and-ai-for-all/)\n\nOur Research\n*   [Research Index](https://openai.com/research/index/)\n*   [Research Overview](https://openai.com/research/)\n*   [Research Residency](https://openai.com/residency/)\n\nLatest Advancements\n*   [OpenAI o3](https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/)\n*   [OpenAI o4-mini](https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/)\n*   [GPT-4o](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-system-card/)\n*   [GPT-4o mini](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-intelligence/)\n*   [Sora](https://openai.com/index/sora-system-card/)\n\nSafety\n*   [Safety Approach](https://openai.com/safety/)\n*   [Security & Privacy](https://openai.com/security-and-privacy/)\n*   [Trust & Transparency](https://openai.com/trust-and-transparency/)\n\nChatGPT\n*   [Explore ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/overview/)\n*   [Team](https://openai.com/chatgpt/team/)\n*   [Enterprise](https://openai.com/chatgpt/enterprise/)\n*   [Education](https://openai.com/chatgpt/education/)\n*   [Pricing](https://openai.com/chatgpt/pricing/)\n*   [Download(opens in a new window)](https://chatgpt.com/download?openaicom-did=2ccfed0e-a8d8-4bfb-b9d9-3abcc9bc3506&openaicom_referred=true)\n\nSora\n*   [Sora Overview](https://openai.com/sora/)\n*   [Features](https://openai.com/sora/#features)\n*   [Pricing](https://openai.com/sora/#pricing)\n*   [Sora log in(opens in a new window)](https://sora.com/)\n\nAPI Platform\n*   [Platform Overview](https://openai.com/api/)\n*   [Pricing](https://openai.com/api/pricing/)\n*   [API log in(opens in a new window)](https://platform.openai.com/login)\n*   [Documentation(opens in a new window)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)\n*   [Developer Forum(opens in a new window)](https://community.openai.com/)\n\nFor Business\n*   [Business Overview](https://openai.com/business/)\n*   [Solutions](https://openai.com/solutions/)\n*   [Contact Sales](https://openai.com/contact-sales/)\n\nCompany\n*   [About Us](https://openai.com/about/)\n*   [Our Charter](https://openai.com/charter/)\n*   [Careers](https://openai.com/careers/)\n*   [Brand](https://openai.com/brand/)\n\nSupport\n*   [Help Center(opens in a new window)](https://help.openai.com/)\n\nMore\n*   [News](https://openai.com/news/)\n*   [Stories](https://openai.com/stories/)\n*   [Livestreams](https://openai.com/live/)\n*   [Podcast](https://openai.com/podcast/)\n\nTerms & Policies\n*   [Terms of Use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use/)\n*   [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/)\n*   [Other Policies](https://openai.com/policies/)\n\n[(opens in a new window)](https://x.com/OpenAI)[(opens in a new window)](https://www.youtube.com/OpenAI)[(opens in a new window)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/openai)[(opens in a new window)](https://github.com/openai)[(opens in a new window)](https://www.instagram.com/openai/)[(opens in a new window)](https://www.tiktok.com/@openai)[(opens in a new window)](https://discord.gg/openai)\n\nOpenAI © 2015–2025 Manage Cookies\n\nEnglish United States\n"
