Analyze the provided research documents and extract ALL entities and relationships to create a comprehensive knowledge graph. Generate TWO JSON files:

1. key_entities.json with this EXACT structure:
{
  "people": [
    {"name": "Full Name", "role": "Their role or title"}
  ],
  "companies": [
    {"name": "Company Name", "industry": "Industry sector"}
  ],
  "organizations": [
    {"name": "Organization Name", "type": "Type of organization"}
  ],
  "legal_entities": [
    {"name": "Entity Name", "type": "Court/Agency/Law Firm"}
  ]
}

2. network_map.json with this EXACT structure:
{
  "relationships": [
    {"source": "Person/Company A", "target": "Person/Company B", "type": "relationship_type"}
  ]
}

EXTRACTION RULES:
- Extract EVERY person, company, organization mentioned
- Use consistent naming (e.g., always "Bob Crants III" not variations)
- Relationship types should be lowercase with underscores: works_for, owns, sued_by, invested_in, former_ceo, board_member, alumnus_of, etc.
- Include ALL relationships: employment, ownership, family, legal, business, educational
- Capture both current and historical relationships (use former_, ex_ prefixes)
- Include negative relationships (sued_by, investigating, bankrupt)

Focus on completeness - better to include too much than miss important connections.
