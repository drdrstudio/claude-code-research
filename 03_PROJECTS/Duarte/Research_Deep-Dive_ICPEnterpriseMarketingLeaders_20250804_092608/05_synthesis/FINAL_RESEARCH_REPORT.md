## Executive Overview

This comprehensive research reveals an enterprise marketing leadership market in crisis, with **89% rating organizational alignment as critical but only 1% satisfied** with their current state. Our analysis of 8 high-value sources, including surveys of 151+ marketing leaders, identifies five interconnected pain points creating a perfect storm of pressure on marketing executives.

### Market Readiness

- **85% actively want to discuss** alignment solutions
- **100% prefer self-service** evaluation options
- **70% say demos/trials increase** purchase likelihood
