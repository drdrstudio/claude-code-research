- Conflicting data sources create mixed messages
- Teams working at cross-purposes

üîß **Integration Impossibility**
- 51% cite integration challenges as adoption barriers
- API compatibility nightmares
- Real-time data sharing remains fantasy

- **3x more likely** to make larger purchases
- Less likely to experience buyer's regret

</div>

<div>

<div class="stat-box">
