## Pain-Agitate-Solution (PAS) Formulas

### Alignment Crisis PAS
**Pain:** "You're a CMO managing a multimillion-dollar budget, but you have no idea if your brand guidelines are being followed until you see campaigns live."

**Agitate:** "While you're in board meetings defending marketing spend, your team is creating off-brand content, duplicating efforts, and working in silos. You find out about problems when it's too late to fix them."

**Solution:** "Get real-time visibility into every marketing activity across your organization. See what's being created, who's working on what, and ensure brand consistency before anything goes live."

### ROI Visibility PAS
**Pain:** "You're responsible for revenue, but you're drowning in spreadsheets trying to prove marketing's impact."

**Agitate:** "You spend hours pulling data from 15 different sources, manually creating reports that are outdated before you finish them. Meanwhile, your CFO questions every dollar while sales takes credit for the pipeline you generated."

**Solution:** "Unite all your marketing data into one source of truth. Prove ROI in real-time, automate reporting, and show exactly how marketing drives revenue with irrefutable data."

### Budget Pressure PAS
**Pain:** "Every year, you fight the same budget battle with your CFO, defending tools and headcount."

**Agitate:** "Despite delivering results, you're seen as a cost center. You lack the data to justify investments, so budgets get cut while expectations increase. Your team is demoralized, and you can't execute your strategy."
