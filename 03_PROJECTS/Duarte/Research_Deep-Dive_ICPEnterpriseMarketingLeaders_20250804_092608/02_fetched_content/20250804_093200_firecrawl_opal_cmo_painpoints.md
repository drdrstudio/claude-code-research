## Key Findings

### Top 5 CMO Pain Points (Validated Research):

1. **Organizational Marketing Alignment (PRIMARY ISSUE)**
   - CMOs have "little-to-no understanding of how their big-picture plan is being executed"
   - Leaders only see brand execution "at the same time as their public audience"
   - Disconnect between strategy and individual execution (social posts, email copy)

2. **CFO-CMO Relationship Tension**
   - CFOs view marketing as "sunk cost" with constant pressure to reduce
   - Marketing leaders must "fight for their ad budget and tech stack every year"
   - Need to "make an ally out of your CFO" for marketing initiatives

3. **Do More With Less Pressure**
   - Directive from top leadership
   - Ad spend often fixed cost, so focus on "maximizing output of people and teams"
   - 32% prioritize "increasing content creation while decreasing marketing team size"

4. **AI Strategy Uncertainty**
   - No clear-cut answer on organizational AI strategy
   - Split between excitement for time-saving potential vs. brand/employee concerns
   - CMOs responsible for deciding actual AI implementation approach

5. **Platform/Channel Decision Complexity**
   - Hardest calls: "where your brand should be active"
   - Brands leaving platforms due to safety, audience migration, or ROI concerns
   - Resource allocation for multi-channel experimentation requirements
